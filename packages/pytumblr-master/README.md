# PyTumblr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tumblr/pytumblr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tumblr/pytumblr)

## Create a client

A `pytumblr.TumblrRestClient` is the object you'll make all of your calls to the
Tumblr API through.  Creating one is this easy:

``` python
client = pytumblr.TumblrRestClient(
    '<consumer_key>',
    '<consumer_secret>',
    '<oauth_token>',
    '<oauth_secret>',
)

client.info() # Grabs the current user information
```

## Supported Methods

### User Methods

``` python
client.info() # get information about the authenticating user
client.dashboard() # get the dashboard for the authenticating user
client.likes() # get the likes for the authenticating user
client.following() # get the blogs followed by the authenticating user

client.follow('codingjester.tumblr.com') # follow a blog
client.unfollow('codingjester.tumblr.com') # unfollow a blog

client.like(id, reblogkey) # like a post
client.unlike(id, reblogkey) # unlike a post
```

### Blog Methods

``` python
client.blog_info('codingjester') # get information about a blog
client.posts('codingjester', **params) # get posts for a blog
client.avatar('codingjester') # get the avatar for a blog
client.blog_likes('codingjester') # get the likes on a blog
client.followers('codingjester') # get the followers of a blog
client.queue('codingjester') # get the queue for a given blog
client.submissions('codingjester') # get the submissions for a given blog
```

### Post Methods

``` python
client.edit_post(blogName, **params); # edit a post

client.reblog(blogName, id, reblogkey); # reblog a post

client.delete_post(blogName, id); # delete a post

# some helper methods for creating posts of varying types
client.create_photo(blogName, **params)
client.create_quote(blogName, **params)
client.create_text(blogName, **params)
client.create_link(blogName, **params)
client.create_chat(blogName, **params)
client.create_audio(blogName, **params)
client.create_video(blogName, **params)
```

A note on tags: When passing tags, as params, please pass them as a list (not
a comma-separated string):

``` python
client.create_text('seejohnrun', tags=['hello', 'world'], ...)
```

### Tagged Methods

```python
client.tagged(tag, **params); # get posts with a given tag
```

## Using the interactive console

This client comes with a nice interactive console to run you through the OAuth
process, grab your tokens (and store them for future use).

You'll need `pyyaml` installed to run it, but then it's just:

``` bash
$ python interactive-console.py
```

and away you go!  Tokens are stored in `~/.tumblr` and are also shared by other
Tumblr API clients like the Ruby client.

## Running tests

The tests (and coverage reports) are run with nose, like this:

``` bash
python setup.py test
```
