#summary How is language usage distributed across websites?

How is language usage distributed across websites? Which sites have the most text? Which sites have pages nearly all in a single language? Which sites have pages containing mixtures of multiple languages? Which sites have single-language pages but in many different languages? What is the distribution of languages on pages from the Netherlands? Where can I find some Klingon text? How has language use on the web changed over the past 10 years?

This note describes some charts containing answers to all of the above questions.

Methodology<br>
Scrape 500M web pages, extracting all the text but ignoring tags, punctuation, and digits. Run a language detector program for 150+ languages across the text, extracting for each web page the top three languages and number of bytes of text in each language.
