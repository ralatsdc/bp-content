V<img alt="" height="350" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/BitcoinDollars.jpg.jpg" width="570" /><figcaption class="credit">Reuters</figcaption><p>Nerds love Bitcoin, and they think you should too.</p> <p>Actually, they think you <em>will</em>. They think it's the payments system, if not the currency, of the future. Something that will end Paypal, not the Fed. A way to send anything to anyone online for little to no fees. But mostly, they think Bitcoin is a technical marvel\u2014because it is. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Though that doesn't make it an economic marvel. At least not yet.</span></p> <!-- START "SMART MONEY" BOX v. 1 --> <!-- END "SMART MONEY" BOX v. 1 --><p>Netscape founder and venture capitalist <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">Marc Andreessen</a> is one of those nerds. He thinks Bitcoin is a game-changing technology on the scale of the PC and the Internet. In his telling, all were discounted as techie playthings, and all went on\u2014or will go\u2014to so fundamentally change how we live that we can't imagine life without them. There's something to that, but it's not enough on it's own. As I put it before, every big idea starts out sounding crazy, but not every crazy-sounding idea ends up being big. Some of them end up being ... <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/bitcoin-is-the-segway-of-currency/281625/">Segway</a>. That said, Bitcoin does hold a lot of promise, and it could change how we pay for things. But it's not there yet.</p> <p>Here's why it could be big, why it isn't, and how it could in seven steps.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> It's called the double-spending problem. Say I send you money online. You can't tell whether I've sent the exact same money to somebody else too. It's just too easy for me to copy the money's digital information, and use it more than once. Maybe I'm honest. But maybe I'm not, and I'm "paying" you with a dollar that's already been spent.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> That's where financial institutions come in. They sit in the middle of every online transaction, and confirm that, yes, this money hasn't been spent before. These intermediaries add trust to the system, but this trust doesn't come cheap: They typically charge 2.5 percent per transaction.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>3.</strong> Bitcoin's genius is it confirms transactions with a decentralized network of people <em>who don't charge fees</em> instead of financial institutions that do. Who are these people doing something for nothing? Well, they're Bitcoin miners, and they're not actually working for free</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">\u2014they're getting paid with new bitcoins.</span></p> <p>For the uninitiated, Bitcoin is a virtual currency with a strictly limited supply that only grows at a slow, preset rate. Basically digital gold. And like actual gold<span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> the only way to get new bitcoins is to "mine" them</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">\u2014but by solving computationally-taxing math problems, not with a pick and pan. In this case, though, the invisible hand is plenty easy to see. Solving these math problems doesn't just win new bitcoins for individual miners. It verifies all Bitcoin transactions for the entire network.</span></p> <p><strong>4.</strong> So why do people bother mining for bitcoins? Well, the question answers itself: because <span style="font-size: 16px;">it's profitable, and they expect it to be even more so if Bitcoin keeps going up in value. This last point is critical. Bitcoin mining has become incredibly competitive the last few years\u2014just look at the <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/into-the-bitcoin-mines/">supercomputer fortresses in Iceland</a> that use geothermal power and Arctic air for cooling\u2014and that competition drives down margins. That means miners are really counting on Bitcoin to continue its journey to infinity and beyond, to keep rising forever.</span></p> <p><strong>5.</strong> When the price of money goes up, the price of everything else goes down. It's called deflation, and it's death for an economy. People put off buying things when they'll cost less tomorrow than today. Companies put off investing when their customers put off buying. And people who borrowed money are stuck trying to pay debts that don't change with wages that do\u2014and have fallen.</p> <p>But Bitcoin's deflationary bias is a feature, not a bug. It's why miners want to mine, and why there are no transaction fees. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Bitcoin can't work as a technology without deflation. The question is whether Bitcoin can work as a currency with it. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Probably not. At least not when there's </span><em style="font-size: 16px;">this</em><span style="font-size: 16px;"> much deflation. You can just how much there's been in the chart below from </span><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-12/the-bitcoin-consumer-price-index-shows-massive-deflation#r=read" style="font-size: 16px;">Peter Coy</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">. It shows how much prices would have had to fall in 2013 if they'd been set in bitcoins instead of dollars.</span></p> <p><img alt="" height="362" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/BitcoinCPI.png" width="570" /></p> <p>Now, to be fair, prices aren't set in bitcoins, and never will be. As <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-doesnt-have-a-deflation-problem-2014-2">Joe Weisenthal</a> points out, it doesn't matter how much prices fall in bitcoins as long as prices are set in dollars\u2014it won't hurt the real economy. But what about the Bitcoin economy? Will Bitcoin deflation hurt it? Almost certainly.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> It's called Gresham's Law, and it's a simple idea: Bad money drives out the good. It dates back to when rulers would literally debase their currencies by reducing the amount of precious metals in coins, but kept the face values the same. (That's how inflation used to work). The government, of course, would try to collect all the old coins to burn them down, and make new ones. But it couldn't always, and this would create a two-tiered money system. There were old coins with more silver and gold, and new coins with less. So people would hoard the old, more valuable coins, and spend the new, less valuable ones.</p> <p>It's the same with bitcoins and dollars. Why spend a currency that might go up in value ten or a hundred times\u2014or more!\u2014when you can spend one that won't? People don't. The only time people do use bitcoins is when they can't use dollars (or euros or yuan)\u2014when they want to do something illegal. Things like buying drugs, gambling online, and evading capital controls. Indeed, <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf">60 percent</a> of <em>all Bitcoin activity</em> happens on the gambling site Satoshi Dice.</p> <p>Other than that, people just hold on to their bitcoins; 64 percent are in accounts that have never been used. Which makes sense, if you think of Bitcoin as a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/bitcoin-is-no-longer-a-currency/274859/">dotcom stock</a> instead of as a currency. It's not like people would use Facebook stock to buy things if they could do that instead of using dollars.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Bitcoin would be a clear step forward as a payments system <em>if</em> people actually used it to pay for things. But they don't. The people who have bitcoins don't use them, and the people who don't have them don't want them. Indeed, a new survey finds that <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/critical-alerts-for-petroleo-brasileiro-expedia-starwood-hotels-resorts-virgin-media-and-nasdaq-omx-released-by-investorsobserver-2013-02-05?reflink=MW_news_stmp">79 percent</a> of people have never used a cryptocurrency, <em>and never want to</em>.</p> <p>But there's an easy fix. Just ask yourself why sellers are so happy to accept Bitcoin. It's not just that there are no fees. It's that merchants can instantly turn their bitcoins into dollars thanks to startups like <a href="https://bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a>. Sure, that means paying a fee, but it's lower than what they'd have to pay the credit card companies\u2014and it means they don't have to worry about Bitcoin's incredibly volatile value.</p> <p>Bitcoin needs the same thing for buyers. It needs a company that can immediately turn a buyer's dollars into bitcoins and then immediately turn a seller's bitcoins back into dollars\u2014all for a lower fee than traditional intermediaries charge. You wouldn't have to worry about buyers not being willing to spend their bitcoins, because it wouldn't be <em>their</em> bitcoins.

He tortured her in every way he could devise.</p> <p>This was my first close encounter with a living, breathing psychopath. I tried on the heavy \u2018head box\u2019 he used in her abduction, visited the basement where he kept her captive, and had nightmares long after he was sent off to prison.</p> <p>I thought nothing so vile would ever hit headlines again. But I was naïve. Perhaps you\u2019re nodding your head, remembering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Smart">Elizabeth Smart</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Jaycee_Lee_Dugard">Jaycee Dugard</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natascha_Kampusch">Natascha Kampusch</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Castro_kidnappings">three women rescued last year from an Ohio basement</a>, and a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/world/europe/london-slave-case-maoist-guru.html">recent case of slavery in London</a>.</p> <p>Over the years, I\u2019ve become obsessed with this type of crime. I\u2019ve researched psychopaths, studied captivity syndromes, and thought a great deal about punishment and retribution. Nietzsche warned that we gaze into the abyss at our peril, but it\u2019s a primal necessity. We analyze terrible crimes in much the same way we heed other means of escaping death. We automatically put ourselves into the shoes of survivors. We scrutinize an airplane\u2019s charred wreckage, amazed that anyone walked away, because, yes, that really could have been you or me.</p> <p>Elizabeth Smart uses her experience as a cautionary tale. She recently published her memoir, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Story-Elizabeth-Smart/dp/1250040159">My Story</a>, </em>and she speaks extensively, promoting a self-defense program for children called <a href="http://www.radkids.org/">RadKids</a>. The core message is that, no matter what your age, yelling, kicking, and fighting back is the best way to foil an abduction.</p> <p>Finding other lessons in these crimes is trickier, but just as important. The victims of these criminals deserve more than a startled gasp and a breathless news cycle. And basic public safety demands that we ask how to stop those who are driven to commit such extremely heinous crimes. Kidnapping and imprisoning victims is not a rash act. It requires an extraordinary amount of dedication, planning, and effort. And the captive\u2019s misery is either of zero consequence or is a source of pleasure.</p> <p>Cameron Hooker\u2014the sadistic kidnapper I researched years ago\u2014is set for release in just a few years, several decades shy of his 104-year sentence. It\u2019s galling to imagine his name simply added to a registry of sexual offenders. Such was the case with Phillip Garrido, who served a fraction of a 50-year sentence for rape and kidnapping. Shortly after Garrido\u2019s release, he kidnapped 11-year-old Jaycee Dugard, whom he held captive\u2014under the noses of his parole officers\u2014for 18 years.</p> <p>There\u2019s constant deliberation over whether such men (and they are overwhelmingly male) ought to be classified as psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists, or some subset of mentally disordered sex offender. Forensic experts analyze brain imagery and administer tests, grasping for clinical diagnoses. But whatever terminology is used, the criminal justice system is tasked with confining such criminals amid ongoing controversy over the length and conditions of their confinement.</p> <p>What causes their behavior? Is it willful, or is it a symptom of mental illness? Professionals who face these criminals daily disagree.</p> <p>An authority clos­e to the Hooker case blames the kidnapper\u2019s behavior on \u201can accident of internal wiring.\u201d Dr. Paul R. Lees-Haley, a forensic psychologist, confides that the most apt definition for these types of criminals is \u201cevil.\u201d And Dr. Bruce Gage, chief of psychiatry for the Washington Department of Corrections and clinical associate professor at the University of Washington, compares psychopathy to colorblindness, explaining that, just as some individuals cannot see the color red, others are blind to human emotions such as sympathy and compassion.</p> <p>(One caveat is that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. Some psychopaths are law-abiding. Psychopaths are not necessarily sadists or kidnappers. But they make up a disproportionate percentage of the criminal population.)</p> <p>Having treated and evaluated a wide range of criminals, Dr. Gage notes that psychopaths typically demonstrate a \u201cfailure to take responsibility\u201d for their actions. They often display callous, unemotional traits and indifference to others. Further, they tend to lack fear and have a \u201creduced response to punishment.\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Martha Stout, author of <em>The Sociopath Next Door</em>, would agree. Stout says that psychopaths have a \u201ctragic deficit\u201d in the paralimbic system (the brain\u2019s emotional area), which prevents them from forming bonds or caring about others. \u201cWhere emotion is concerned, psychopaths can see it in others when they make a concerted conscious effort,\u201d Stout says. \u201cThey just don't care to do so unless they can use it to their own advantage.\u201d  </p> <p>But others, such as Jennifer Skeem, professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, argue that psychopaths are just misunderstood and can be rehabilitated. \u201cPsychopathy tends to be used as a label for people we do not like, cannot understand, or construe as evil,\u201d Skeem says.</p> <p>The controversy will doubtless continue. Experts disagree over how violent psychopaths should be housed and whether they can be rehabilitated. Studies are cited by both sides. But such is the subtle nature of human behavior that, while the science may be objective, the results of such studies are often open to subjective interpretation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the justice system is burdened with the practical issues of keeping these criminals behind bars. In some cases, sexually violent predators are detained not in prisons, but in mental institutions. Such confinement, termed \u201ccivil commitment,\u201d became federal law with the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, and is also employed in 20 states.</p> <p>But this, too, is controversial. Many believe mental health institutions are not the proper place for dangerous criminals, who are better suited to correctional facilities. And some argue that their civil commitment is unfair to mental health professionals and to patients diagnosed with severe, persistent mental health problems.</p> <p>Since California uses civil commitment, it\u2019s possible that once Cameron Hooker has served his time in Folsom Prison, he\u2019ll be deemed a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d and transferred to forensic lock-up in a mental institution. But this isn\u2019t mandatory, and no one can predict whether he will qualify for civil commitment. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019ll be set free to stroll the streets.</p> <p>Dr. Robert Hare, who is perhaps the leading authority on the subject of psychopaths, created the most widely used tool for keeping criminals like Hooker behind bars. The <em>Psychopathy Checklist</em>, also called the PCL or PCL-R, is considered the gold standard in assessing psychopathy. In his book, <em><u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Without-Conscience-Disturbing-World-Psychopaths/dp/1572304510">Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us</a></u></em>, Dr. Hare states that there \u201cis ample evidence that a careful diagnosis of psychopathy, based on the <em>Psychopathy Checklist</em>, greatly reduces the risks associated with decisions in the criminal justice system. Properly used, it can help to differentiate those offenders who pose little risk to society from those who are at a high risk for recidivism or violence.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps, properly used, the <em>Psychopathy Checklist</em> can remove the guesswork over which individuals are most dangerous. But of course, no punishment can truly fit the crime. No pound of flesh or pile of cash can buy back years of being chained in the dark. </p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c143f2/sc/39/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fcan-psychopaths-be-rehabilitated%2F283300%2F&amp;t=Can+Psychopaths+Be+Rehabilitated%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fcan-psychopaths-be-rehabilitated%2F283300%2F&amp;t=Can+Psychopaths+Be+Rehabilitated%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fcan-psychopaths-be-rehabilitated%2F283300%2F&amp;t=Can+Psychopaths+Be+Rehabilitated%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fcan-psychopaths-be-rehabilitated%2F283300%2F&amp;t=Can+Psychopaths+Be+Rehabilitated%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fcan-psychopaths-be-rehabilitated%2F283300%2F&amp;t=Can+Psychopaths+Be+Rehabilitated%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/sc/39/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/sc/39/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/sc/39/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/sc/39/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/sc/39/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/sc/39/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530161970/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f2/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/f5c4-ezrzOE" width="1" />

Your friends or relatives have a baby; you want to give a gift that will be not just temporarily useful for the new parents, but continually so. And meaningful for the baby, too, as he or she gets older. The solution? A book\u2014a book being, truly, the gift that keeps on giving. <i>Good Night, Moon</i>, maybe. Or <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>. Or <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. Or <i>Make Way for Ducklings</i>. You write an inscription in the book's blank page. You wrap it up. You give your gift. Perfect. </p> <p class="p1">The only problem? There's a good chance that approximately 10 other people had the same idea you did, which means that your friends or relatives now have 11 copies of <i>Goodnight, Moon</i>. And, unlike other duplicate gifts, none of these copies can be returned\u2014because, of course, well-meaning gift-givers like you have inscribed them with thoughtful personal messages. </p> <p class="p1">The people at the <a href="http://hugobookstores.com/andover">Andover Bookstore</a> in Andover, Massachusetts think they have a solution to this problem: a baby-book registry. Which is exactly what it sounds like. Expectant parents can register for the books they'd like to include in their kids' libraries, and gift-givers can buy the books relatively confident that theirs will be the only offering of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> or <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> that makes its way into the collection. </p> <p class="p1">As the store explained it in a recent email to customers: </p> <blockquote> <p class="p3">Parents-to-be can email us with their name, due date, and date of the shower, and we will create a custom account for your baby! Including a list of books you are hoping to receive will allow us to stock those books, and give the list to your friends when they come in \u2014 all they have to do is let us know whose registry they are shopping for! Our computer system will tell us if someone has already bought the same book under your registry, so there is no need to worry about duplicates!</p> </blockquote> <p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">The Andover Bookstore was founded 1809, and (after Bethlehem, Pennsylvania's <a href="http://moravian.indiebound.com/about-moravian-book-shop">Moravian Book Shop</a>) it's the second-oldest continuously operating bookstore in the United States. It's full of plush couches and fireplaces. </span>\u200b<span>It regularly hosts poetry readings. </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">"</span><span>People who lived here years ago come back to visit," it says of itself, "and say that this is one of the few places in town that hasn\u2019t changed." The Andover Bookstore, in other words, is not the first kind of establishment you might associate with a practice that has generally been the province of the department stores and Targets and Amazons of the world. </span></p> <p class="p2"><span>But the registry resulted, actually, from a hack. A bookstore-y kind of hack. </span>The store, Chantel Coughlin, its manager, told me, built its book registry on top of the software it uses for its loyalty program. <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">"If you're in our frequent buyer program," Coughlin says, "we pull up your account, and we scan your books in, and you get points toward your sales." And the system "will automatically tell us if you've read a book before." The system, they realized, could be jury-rigged into a registry. So they figured they try it as an experiment. </span></p> <p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">The registry is new\u2014about two weeks old\u2014but Coughlin says that people have responded well to the idea so far.  And "</span>we're hoping that it'll be something that'll take off and be a really popular thing," she says.</p> <p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">She also\u2014being a bookstore manager\u2014notes that the existence of a registry need not preclude customers from requesting multiples of the same book. "Ki</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">ds break books," she says, "so sometimes it's okay to have that second copy." </span></p> <p class="p2"><em>Via <a href="https://twitter.com/seancarlson/status/425669611078840320">Sean Carlson</a></em></p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c143f3/sc/38/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fa-gift-registry-for-baby-books%2F283619%2F&amp;t=A+Gift+Registry+for+Baby+Books" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fa-gift-registry-for-baby-books%2F283619%2F&amp;t=A+Gift+Registry+for+Baby+Books" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fa-gift-registry-for-baby-books%2F283619%2F&amp;t=A+Gift+Registry+for+Baby+Books" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fa-gift-registry-for-baby-books%2F283619%2F&amp;t=A+Gift+Registry+for+Baby+Books" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fa-gift-registry-for-baby-books%2F283619%2F&amp;t=A+Gift+Registry+for+Baby+Books" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530161969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c143f3/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/4z_HnviO8C4" width="1" />

What he got <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/moviegoer-wearing-google-glass-removed-theater-questioned-feds/">instead</a> was a thorough grilling from the FBI, who suspected he intended to record and distribute the Chris Pine-fronted flick.</p> <p>The headlines that resulted made for yet another example of <em>The Simpsons</em> presaging real life. (Other examples include the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/01/how-the-simpsons-explains-the-manti-teo-fake-girlfriend-saga/267296/">Manti Te\u2019o fake-girlfriend affair</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSimpsons/statuses/429054640337203200">Seahawks facing the Broncos at the Super Bowl</a>). Days earlier, the show had tackled Hollywood\u2019s zeal to prosecute movie pirates with an installment called "Steal This Episode." \u201cIt\u2019s always magic when something in real life happens alongside the silly stuff in our show,\u201d says Matt Selman, an executive producer on <em>The Simpsons</em>.</p> <p><!-- START "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --></p> <!-- END "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>In \u201cSteal This Episode,\u201d Homer satiates his jealousy of not yet having seen the latest <em>Radioactive Man Re-Rises</em> by illegally downloading it. That transgression kicks off a serial tirade of piracy until Marge sends a confessional letter to Hollywood (including a check), spurring Homer\u2019s arrest by the FBI (who shut down one of his backyard screenings), followed by escape and immunity offering by the Swedish embassy.</p> <p>It was unadulterated cultural commentary on piracy, mainlined through Homer\u2019s naïve one-liners (\u201cIllegally download it? Is that legal?\u201d). The most-watched <em>Simpsons</em> episode in three years, it set Reddit ablaze with several threads and hundreds of comments and was praised by critics, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/steal-this-episode-106693">who called it</a> a return to form for the show. Shortly after the Google Glass incident, the episode\u2019s prescience was proved yet again in ironic fashion: Fox ordered a man to pay $10.5 million in damages for hosting links to watch <em>The Simpsons</em>.</p> <p>I spoke with Selman about what led to one of the most talked-about installments of <em>The Simpsons</em> in recent history.</p> <hr /><p><strong>At the beginning of the episode, Homer\u2019s coworkers Lenny and Karl strike up a conversation at the water cooler about the latest <em>Radioactive Man</em> film. Is this a common occurrence?</strong></p> <p>Homer comes in and everyone\u2019s talking about the movie and he doesn\u2019t want it to be ruined. It\u2019s what we felt was a common phenomenon of modern life, where you have to avoid something really popular that everyone has seen but you. It\u2019s sometimes really hard to avoid finding out what happens. Certainly at work on <em>The Simpsons</em>, someone will come in Monday after a big [episode of] <em>Game of Thrones</em> and we\u2019ll all be talking about it and we\u2019ll be like, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen it: get out.\u201d Or a big episode of <em>Breaking Bad</em> or a serialized TV show. [\u201cSteal This Episode\u201d] is mainly about movies but I think a lot of the stuff talked about applies to TV shows with all the downloading and spoilers and the way people experience media now.</p> <p><strong>Has anything been ruined for you?</strong></p> <p>A small example is something from another <em>Game of Thrones</em> [episode], where I really didn\u2019t want the show to be ruined and then I read an interview with George R. R. Martin about who would win\u2014Jaime Lannister or Aragorn\u2014in a fight. That\u2019s a safe article for me to read, right? Spoiler alert if you\u2019re reading this article at home, but the first thing out of George R. R. Martin\u2019s mouth was, \u201cWell of course the fight would take place before Jamie\u2019s hand gets cut off.\u201d And I was like, \u201cFuck!\u201d I tried so hard to avoid that.</p> <p><strong>With this episode, are you trying to comment on things that have relevance now?</strong></p> <p>We were trying to be somewhat current, but reference bigger trends that will be around for a while. <em>The Simpsons</em> isn\u2019t going to do an episode on Justin Bieber being arrested while drunk or whatever he did, but maybe we\u2019d do a story on the trend of bad behavior in teen stars. When Homer was upset in the theater, I think we needed a reason for Homer to pirate movies that isn\u2019t just him being greedy. You\u2019re not as involved in his story if his reasons are selfish. His reasons are benevolent and you can\u2019t really not relate to them. And that\u2019s a way more involving story. When you\u2019re sitting in a theater and you\u2019ve paid and there\u2019s a whole ton of ads\u2014$20 for the 3D ticket and $20 for food and $20 for parking and a babysitter\u2014and you go see a movie that probably isn\u2019t even that great and now you\u2019re going to show me an ad: I mean, come on! The line of integrity in even popular entertainment and advertising has been obliterated. Which is obviously the kind of point we\u2019re making in that episode. At the end of the episode we\u2019re trying to sell you aftershave.</p> <p><strong>Why is the topic of piracy relevant now?</strong></p> <p>I got into this story because of that guy Kim Dotcom. He\u2019s a very entertaining character. Obviously, for whatever reasons media companies are fighting people\u2019s feelings [about] media companies. It\u2019s never going to be a black and white issue. And that\u2019s what was interesting about it for us, that this is not a black and white issue. Movie streaming and downloading is a crime; however, the people they\u2019re stealing from are also criminals.</p> <p>I just like the overall theme that when there\u2019s a conflict over money, both sides will try to cloak themselves in nobility. The movie corporations will say, \u201cYou\u2019re putting craftsmen out of work.\u201d The movie corporations, given the opportunity, will steal and deny the money they owe people until they are literally forced at gunpoint to hand it over. People streaming these movies and stealing them are definitely exploiting the hard work and creative content that other people are literally owed for, but they\u2019re not really costing the companies that much money. The movie pirates are saying, \u201cWe\u2019re doing it in the name of freedom! And openness and an open world!\u201d But really, they\u2019re just pocketing money. Corporations would say you\u2019re stealing from craftsmen. You\u2019re putting these good people out of business when they\u2019re equally as malicious and rule-breaking as the pirates.</p> <p><strong>Marge sends money off to Hollywood with an apologetic note, and she naively says, \u201cNow it will go to the people who made the magic happen on screen.\u201d </strong></p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <figure style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" height="591" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/02/simpsons_letter/a3af52dd2.png" width="549" /><figcaption class="credit">Fox</figcaption></figure></div> <p><strong>Do you have any idea where this money goes that we pay at the box office?</strong></p> <p>Studio accounting is one of the murkiest financial calculations in the world, and it\u2019s pretty much accepted in Hollywood that if a creator has ownership in a property, they will probably have to sue the company to get their agreed upon royalty. There are so many ways to hide that money. I mean, <em>The Simpsons</em> is still technically in the red. It\u2019s hard to believe.</p> <p><strong>How\u2019s that?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask News Corp. It\u2019s because they bill off everything. They take the profits and they take the money spent in other areas and they take that away from the bill against <em>The Simpsons</em>. I don\u2019t have any profits in <em>The Simpsons</em> so it doesn\u2019t affect me, but it <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/how-hollywood-accounting-can-make-a-450-million-movie-unprofitable/245134/">certainly is a famous thing</a> in Hollywood that hugely successful movies\u2014the guy that has the one net point\u2014will get a profit statement saying, \u201cThis movie lost money.\u201d Like Harry Potter lost money or a giant hit lost money because they find ways to hide the money.</p> <p><strong>I was going to ask about the dig at Hulu Plus in the episode [Subjected to ads in the cinema, Homer wails, \u201cIf I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus\u201d]. Isn\u2019t Fox one of the largest shareholders at Hulu?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, well we make fun of Fox a lot, but they know it\u2019s good business to be made fun of. They always accept it in good humor because it makes them seem cool and it doesn\u2019t cost them anything. Being made fun of is a form of flattery. The people at Hulu tweeted about that.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p>We once heard a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23simpsons&amp;src=hash">#simpsons</a> MT/ <a href="https://twitter.com/mattselman">@mattselman</a> Hulu doesn't hold a grudge after our shot at Hulu Plus.</p> \u2014 hulu (@hulu) <a href="https://twitter.com/hulu/statuses/420367631305023489">January 7, 2014</a></blockquote> <p>It\u2019s always entertaining when media companies have a sense of humor or at least act like they do. I believe we got thumb notes saying "don\u2019t do that joke," and we just did it anyway because we\u2019re a satirical show. We\u2019re expressing a satirical idea, and that line got a lot of response from people that watch the show on Hulu.</p> <p><strong>Are you an advocate of pirating?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t think I am. I guess I\u2019m an advocate for people being honest about what they\u2019re really up to. I don\u2019t think piracy is as big a problem as everyone really thinks it is. I think the reason they pirate is because the companies don\u2019t make things available. The tiny factory that makes a crappy bootleg of <em>The Dark Knight</em> sold on the streets of Taiwan the week it opens\u2014that\u2019s pure piracy, right there. But streaming episodes of a TV show that isn\u2019t available anywhere else\u2014it\u2019s not on iTunes or whatever\u2014is different. I think iTunes has proven if you make it easy and relatively cheap to buy something for a fair price, people will do it. So why can\u2019t they do that for movies and TV as well?</p> <p>I would say I\u2019m 80 percent against piracy and 20 percent not. There are some arguments that say piracy actually makes shows make more money because they\u2019re getting it out there. Putting Monty Python sketches on YouTube for free, it actually helps the sale of the back catalog of Monty Python. That point has been made. Young people will say, \u201cWell, why should I pay for movies, especially for comedies, if there\u2019s all this piracy?\u201d And that\u2019s sad because we\u2019re a generation who has lost the experience of going to a comedy movie in a theatre and laughing with the crowd.</p> <p><strong>Was it difficult to structure this episode and tell the story through humor?</strong></p> <p>Piracy is such a complicated issue, and to try and get into the nitty gritty of it would be boring. It gets very technical and we\u2019d have to do so much explaining before anyone would even understand what we\u2019re talking about. We tried to keep it simple and give it an emotional story about Marge accidently ratting out Homer and then confessing to it. We kept adding layers because at one level, it\u2019s purely satirical, at another it\u2019s about a problem in a marriage and it\u2019s a very self-referential episode. At the end of the episode, it\u2019s using movie storytelling to come to a blockbuster movie conclusion.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be honest: It\u2019s one of the best ones I\u2019ve ever worked on. Super excited about it. I wish they could all be that good.</p> <p><strong>What kind of feedback did you get from this episode?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t read a lot of feedback because often it makes me want to kill myself. More than that, if anyone is talking about the show after 25 years in any capacity, I\u2019m overjoyed. I knew this was a juicy issue when we started working on it, and we really worked hard to be really obnoxious about it and bring up a lot of areas that people could respond to. Kim Dotcom liked it. He <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/420133352876675072">tweeted about it</a>, so even though I\u2019m 80 percent against Kim Dotcom, I 20 percent love him.

And they\u2019ve already taken over the capital\u2014at least on TV.</p> <p>Shows and films set in Washington have undergone a dramatic revolution. Gone are the starry-eyed days of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/"><em>The </em><em>West Wing</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031679/"><em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em></a>. In are the Machiavellian intrigues on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/"><em>House of Cards</em></a>, the blundering characters on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/"><em>Veep</em></a>, and the scandals on, well, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837576/"><em>Scandal</em></a>. This shift reflects the <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115708/new-republic-december-cover-washington-tv">viewing habits</a> of a more disillusioned American public as well as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/fashion/veep-hits-lots-of-nerves.html">sensibilities</a> of millennials (the <em>Girls</em> generation doesn\u2019t do feel-good).</p> <p>But the changing portrayal of Washington is as much a geographical shift as a generational one. Two of the leading shows in this cynical wave\u2014<em>House of Cards </em>and <em>Veep</em>\u2014are British in origin. <em>House of Cards</em>, whose second season debuts on February 14, is an American recreation of its <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098825/">British namesake</a>\u2014hence the (spoiler alert!) convoluted plotline in which Kevin Spacey\u2019s character seeks to maneuver directly from being House majority whip to president. (In the U.K.\u2019s parliamentary system, an MP can become prime minister by taking down the government; in the American system, Spacey has to take a detour through the vice president\u2019s office.)</p> <p><em>Veep</em>, for its part, descends from a long line of British government spoofs\u2014think of it as \u201cMr. Bean Goes to Washington.\u201d <em>Veep</em>\u2019s Scottish creator, Armando Iannucci, was behind the BBC\u2019s Whitehall satire <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459159/"><em>The Thick of It</em></a>. His movie spinoff <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226774/"><em>In the Loop</em></a> lampooned the Anglo-American \u201cSpecial Relationship.\u201d Iannucci was, in turn, inspired by the BBC\u2019s 1980s classics <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080306/"><em>Yes Minister</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086831/"><em>Yes, Prime Minister</em></a>\u2014the best depictions from either side of the Atlantic of government at its most surreal.</p> <p>Washington shows used to follow the same fundamental trope: someone powerful trying to fight for the \u201clittle guy\u201d collides with someone powerful out to screw the \u201clittle guy.\u201d But the reality of the nation\u2019s capital is far more interesting: Everyone in Washington feels like the \u201clittle guy\u201d even if, Oz-like, their frailties are obscured by the trappings of power. The inner lives\u2014and inner workings\u2014of government are far more layered than simple battles of good and evil.</p> <p>Why is Hollywood now turning to Britain for inspiration about American politics? Three reasons stand out.</p> <p>The first is proximity to political power. Most Western countries have capitals that are also their cultural centers. In London, as in Paris or Rome, artists reside alongside politicians. Proximity breeds contempt. But it also breeds understanding\u2014or at least more accurate mocking. For centuries, British writers were dependent on royal patronage or whim for their careers. As they negotiated ever-changing political circumstances, they sought to humanize or pillory their leaders\u2014but always to understand them as artistic subjects. Shakespeare is the greatest example of the intermingling of British writing and power.</p> <p>The effects of proximity persist to this day. <em>Yes Minister</em> co-creator Jonathan Lynn <a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/opiniondetails/blogs/opinion/Learning-how-to-be-a-minister">became</a> interested in satire after meeting young politicos at Cambridge University: \u201cThey \u2026 were the most pompous, self-satisfied, self-important bunch of clowns that I\u2019ve ever clapped eyes on.\u2026 I thought at that point that the only way that I could ever contribute to politics is making fun of the politicians.\u201d</p> <p>In America, D.C.\u2019s separation from New York and Los Angeles has stunted cultural understanding of government. In the case of Hollywood and Washington, distance has bred mutual admiration. It\u2019s not just the usual clichés about these two \u201ccompany towns\u201d\u2014\u201cD.C. is Hollywood for ugly people,\u201d \u201cpoliticians are like actors reading their lines,\u201d \u201ceveryone is playing a role,\u201d etc. This mutual admiration reflects how little Hollywood and Washington really understand each other (fundraisers, Jack Valenti, and the Emanuel brothers aside) and how much they envy their differences.</p> <p>For Hollywood, idealized Washington has served as a projection of the impact that artists seek through their work\u2014or their ego. T.A. Frank <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115690/washington-tv-politics-scandal-homeland-veep">described</a> watching <em>The West Wing </em>as a bit like being \u201cforced to watch [Aaron Sorkin] play with his action figures, or possibly himself.\u201d For Washington, idealized Hollywood is a place where you can be creative\u2014free of the constraints imposed by low salaries, bland wardrobes, and the puritan moralism that politicos at least have to feign. We want to play with the toys that real fame provides. To bring it back to high school: Beautiful people long to be taken seriously; nerds long to be cool. Hence the speechwriters and screenwriters who shuttle back and forth between the cities trying to be both smart and cool.</p> <figure><img alt="" height="288" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/02/frank_underwood/069a0d616.png" width="570" /><figcaption class="caption">Kevin Spacey stars as the sinister Congressman Frank Underwood in <em>House of Cards</em>. (Netflix)</figcaption></figure><p>There is a second reason why London understands Washington so well: class. With <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/business/economy/in-us-an-inequality-gap-of-sobering-breadth.html">rising inequality</a>, America is becoming more like traditionally class-based Britain (by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/05/oecd-ineqaulity-report-uk-us">several</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/income-inequality-wall-street_n_3762422.html">measures</a>, in fact, the U.S. is more unequal now than the U.K.). And Washington is its most class-based city. D.C., of course, has always had a touch of Victorian England in it; the Crawley family from <em>Downton Abbey </em>would fit right in. Social relations in Washington are hierarchical and formal: As with lord and vassal, you provide homage to your boss, who in turn offers you favors and protection. But peer beneath the veneer of propriety and you\u2019ll find every imaginable indiscretion. Not to mention, the Empire is in decline.</p> <p>British humor in particular has historically been class-based and class-reinforcing. In a society that readily acknowledges its social hierarchy, there is a great deal of fun to be had in temporarily subverting it. Comedy, in shows<strong> </strong>like <em>Yes Minister </em>and <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098837/">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em>, thus functions as a safety valve, alleviating tension while heightening distinctions of power and privilege (the approach is also evident in British dramas like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066722/"><em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em></a>, the original <em>Downton Abbey</em>). We\u2019re now beginning to see Washington dramas explore issues of class as well. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327773/"><em>Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler</em></a> and Steven Spielberg\u2019s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443272/"><em>Lincoln</em></a>, for instance, portrayed racial and socioeconomic inequality with an authenticity that Charlie Young\u2019s character in <em>The West Wing</em> never attained.</p> <p></p><p> But it\u2019s not just a deeper understanding of class that makes British shows newly resonant in the U.S. Whereas Americans once viewed power very differently than Brits, we\u2019re now coming around to the view of our counterparts across the pond. </p><p>In the U.S., it\u2019s not just speechwriters-screenwriters who fashion idealized leaders; we all do. Americans like to imagine that we could\u2014by choice!\u2014be president \u201cwhen we grow up.\u201d And while scheming presidents have become a fixture on screen since Watergate, they are depicted as usurpers to our democratic tradition\u2014Nixons to our Camelot.</p> <p>In Britain, power has historically been inherited. Recognizing that the accident of birth could propel anyone to the throne, British artists have often portrayed their monarchs as real human beings, with every conceivable failing or foible. As Shakespeare wrote in <em>Henry IV</em>, \u201cUneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, power in British history is not just inherited. It is acquired by some, squandered by others, and stolen from still others. Henry VII seized the crown from Richard III in battle. His son Henry VIII initially ceded much of his authority to his advisor Cardinal Wolsey, only to later increase his power at the expense of the Catholic Church. A century later, Charles I lost power\u2014along with his head\u2014in the English Civil War. Charles II regained the crown, but Parliament ditched his younger brother and chosen successor, James II, in favor of William and Mary in the Glorious Revolution.</p> <p>Even in today\u2019s democratic Britain, court intrigue remains at the heart of politics. Margaret Thatcher was ousted by a breakaway faction within her Conservative Party. Tony Blair was unseated by Gordon Brown. If Labour leader Ed Miliband eventually becomes prime minister, the key moment in his rise will be when he <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10470106/Ed-Miliband-admits-relationship-with-brother-David-is-still-healing.html">turned on his brother</a>. This all makes for good drama. </p><p> American politics has its own endless machinations. But the primacy of elections has contributed to the popular conception that the most dramatic political moments occur in public rather than in the cloistered corridors of power. Yet in today\u2019s America, where the meritocracy seems to be faltering and where elections\u2014indeed the entire economic and social system\u2014increasingly appear rigged by a new aristocracy, the British depiction of power politics has never rung more true.</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c14b43/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-em-house-of-cards-em-hypothesis-why-london-understands-washington-better-than-hollywood%2F283600%2F&amp;t=The+House+of+Cards%3C%2Fem%3E+Hypothesis%3A+Why+London+Understands+Washington+Better+Than+Hollywood" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-em-house-of-cards-em-hypothesis-why-london-understands-washington-better-than-hollywood%2F283600%2F&amp;t=The+House+of+Cards%3C%2Fem%3E+Hypothesis%3A+Why+London+Understands+Washington+Better+Than+Hollywood" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-em-house-of-cards-em-hypothesis-why-london-understands-washington-better-than-hollywood%2F283600%2F&amp;t=The+House+of+Cards%3C%2Fem%3E+Hypothesis%3A+Why+London+Understands+Washington+Better+Than+Hollywood" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-em-house-of-cards-em-hypothesis-why-london-understands-washington-better-than-hollywood%2F283600%2F&amp;t=The+House+of+Cards%3C%2Fem%3E+Hypothesis%3A+Why+London+Understands+Washington+Better+Than+Hollywood" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-em-house-of-cards-em-hypothesis-why-london-understands-washington-better-than-hollywood%2F283600%2F&amp;t=The+House+of+Cards%3C%2Fem%3E+Hypothesis%3A+Why+London+Understands+Washington+Better+Than+Hollywood" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530211306/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c14b43/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/k5-k5XWi-rs" width="1" />

It might kill a tiny bit of America's work ethic, however.</p> <p>Yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Capitol Hill's official number-cruncher, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-Outlook2014.pdf">reported</a> that the health reform law would probably encourage more adults to cut back their work hours than it had previously predicted. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act makes it easier to get insurance without a full-time job, and some employees will probably take advantage of its benefits by working less. Figuring out just how many people will respond that way takes some math and guesswork, and, based on a bit of new research, the CBO had changed its estimates.  </p> <p>Ten years out, it said, the Affordable Care Act will crimp the labor force by the equivalent of 2.5 million workers. Some <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/white-house/truth-and-consequences-of-obamacare-distortion-20140205">misleading</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/us/politics/budget-office-revises-estimates-of-health-care-enrollment.html?_r=1">headlines</a> aside, businesses won't really need to hire any less. The unemployment rate won't be affected much, if at all. More adults will simply decide to take it easy.*</p> <p>Republicans, unsurprisingly, are counting this as a big strike against Obamacare. Democrats, meanwhile, say it's proof that the law makes our convoluted healthcare system a bit more humane. What should you think? How should you <em>feel</em>? Here's a brief guide.</p> <h3><strong>You should feel upset...</strong></h3> <p>...if you don't believe it's ever a good idea to discourage people from working.</p> <p>Again, Obamacare is designed to make it easier for people to afford insurance without a full-time job. And, unless a Calvinist revival suddenly sweeps the nation, that means some people probably won't feel compelled to work the hours they did before.</p> <p>Some Americans might specifically choose to work less for fear of missing out on federal aid. The Affordable Care Act extends Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults, and it gives subsidies to some households so they can buy private insurance on the new healthcare exchanges. Because those benefits phase out for higher earners, some workers could decide that they're better off taking home a smaller paycheck while keeping their government help\u2014especially if they can qualify for welfare programs like food stamps as well.  </p> <p>You may or may not object to that on a moral level. But there might be economic reasons to worry as well. America's workforce participation rate\u2014the percentage of adults either looking for a job or in one\u2014is dropping. And it's going to keep dropping as the Baby Boomers age into retirement. That will mean fewer employees paying taxes to support programs like Social Security. The CBO essentially tells us Obamacare will make this problem slightly worse.  </p> <h3><strong>You should feel thrilled...</strong></h3> <p>...if you think people shouldn't have to stay in a terrible job just for health insurance.</p> <p>Most American adults get health insurance through their employer. As a result, many end up stuck in jobs they'd prefer to leave simply because they want to keep their healthcare plan. Policy wonks refer to this as "job lock." </p> <p>In a way, the CBO report simply says that Obamacare helps cure job lock. And, as Matt Yglesias wrote yesterday, that could be <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/04/obamacare_as_job_killer_how_the_cbo_thinks_it_ll_work.html">a wonderful thing</a> for many familes. Mothers might be able to cut back their time at work in order to take care of their children. Older workers who don't qualify for Medicare yet might be able to ease up at the office. People are going to see their quality of life improve, and even if it comes at a small economic cost, that's a completely legitimate goal for public policy. </p> <p>Another point to keep in mind: a little bit of workforce shrinkage might be a completely acceptable tradeoff if it means insuring millions. </p> <h3><strong>You should feel "meh"...</strong></h3> <p>...if you realize this estimate is an example of how Washington's policy debates thrive on a false sense of precision and certainty about the future. The truth is, we don't know exactly how people will change their work habits when they're offered government subsidies to buy insurance, and if the CBO were being 100 percent transparent, they would probably <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/10-25-2012-Labor_Supply_and_Fiscal_Policy.pdf">provide a range of possible outcomes</a>. Moreover, it's really hard to predict what the job market will look like 10 years from now. If robots really are coming for all our jobs\u2014I'm not being glib; it's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/what-jobs-will-the-robots-take/283239/">possible</a>\u2014we're going to be a lot less worried about workforce participation, and a lot more worried about whether the unemployed can see a doctor. </p> <hr /><p>*Here's the CBO's exact language. Note, it says workforce reductions will be due "almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply." To wit: </p> <p><em>The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor, so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week).</em></p> <p> </p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c0b904/sc/1/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fobamacare-is-going-to-make-americans-a-little-lazier-so-what%2F283622%2F&amp;t=Obamacare+Is+Going+to+Make+Americans+a+Little+Lazier%E2%80%94So+What%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fobamacare-is-going-to-make-americans-a-little-lazier-so-what%2F283622%2F&amp;t=Obamacare+Is+Going+to+Make+Americans+a+Little+Lazier%E2%80%94So+What%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fobamacare-is-going-to-make-americans-a-little-lazier-so-what%2F283622%2F&amp;t=Obamacare+Is+Going+to+Make+Americans+a+Little+Lazier%E2%80%94So+What%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fobamacare-is-going-to-make-americans-a-little-lazier-so-what%2F283622%2F&amp;t=Obamacare+Is+Going+to+Make+Americans+a+Little+Lazier%E2%80%94So+What%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fobamacare-is-going-to-make-americans-a-little-lazier-so-what%2F283622%2F&amp;t=Obamacare+Is+Going+to+Make+Americans+a+Little+Lazier%E2%80%94So+What%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/187557440649/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0b904/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/sL5NyCAJwEo" width="1" />

(Marko Djurica/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p>KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Another Sunday, another massive demonstration in Kiev.</p> <p>As they have for the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/what-europe-means-to-ukraines-protesters/282327/">last two-plus months</a>, tens of thousands of protesters poured into the center of the Ukrainian capital this past weekend. In the freezing cold, they chanted the same slogans that they have in weeks past: \u201c<em>Bandu het</em>!\u201d (Out with the gang!); \u201c<em>Zeka het</em>!\u201d (Out with the convict!); and their all-time-favorite, \u201cRe-vo-lu-TSIA!\u201d Opposition leaders promised to fight to the bitter end, while demonstrators screamed until they were hoarse, clamoring for results. Their list of stipulations is long, but as time has passed, the appeals have been distilled down to a single, mantra-like demand: President Viktor Yanukovych must go. Now.</p> <p>Some commentators have picked up on the overwhelming sense of déjà vu marking recent rallies. \u201cFebruary 2,\u201d <a href="https://twitter.com/MaloverjanBBC/status/429344755882143744">tweeted</a> Juri Maloverjan of the BBC\u2019s Russian Service, \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d</p> <p>So much has happened over the course of Ukraine\u2019s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/what-europe-means-to-ukraines-protesters/282327/">pro-European Union, anti-government</a> protests, and yet nothing has changed. Lenin statues <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/the-remarkable-history-behind-ukraines-toppled-lenin-statue/282141/">have been toppled</a>, the prime minister <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/01/ukraines-prime-minister-resigns-anti-protest-laws-repealed/100670/">has been replaced</a>, and pitched battles <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/01/how-an-armenian-and-a-belarusian-died-for-a-ukrainian-revolution/283322/">have broken out</a> on the streets of Kiev. And yet, as before, President Yanukovych is still in power. The protesters remain entrenched behind the colossal barricades they have erected to protect their tent camp, a city within a city, while Ukraine inches ever closer to Russia. And the West is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/world/europe/us-and-europe-work-on-financial-solution-to-ukraine-crisis.html">scrambling</a>\u2014so far, helplessly\u2014to respond.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/special-report/democracy" name="&amp;lid=Democracy-Bug&amp;lpos=Promo-Bug" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" title="The Democracy Report"><img alt="The Democracy Report" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/front/images/specialreports/democracy/bug.png" /></a> </p><p>The turmoil in Ukraine, a nation of 45 million and territorially Europe\u2019s second-largest country after Russia, matters. And in the near term, the national crisis could play out in one of three ways: the stalemate could continue; a national-unity government of opposition and pro-government officials could form and ease Yanukovych from the scene at a later date; or the president could resign. Whatever the outcome, however, the country\u2019s unrest won\u2019t end any time soon.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the most likely scenario\u2014that Yanukovych, a tough, Soviet-style apparatchik from the country\u2019s industrial east, who <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25182830">served</a> two prison terms in his youth for violent crimes, clings to power. He is a fighter and has been driven from office by a mass protest movement once before, during the 2004-2005 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25210230">Orange Revolution</a>. Here in Kiev, the conventional wisdom is that Yanukovych, following this humiliation, swore to never swallow that bitter pill again.</p> <p>Moreover, Yanukovych now has a stronger incentive not to concede. Unlike in 2004, a loss this time around will undoubtedly mean the end of his political career, if not his personal wealth and possibly even his life. He also has the Kremlin\u2019s carrots and sticks to consider. According to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25996453">Russian officials and news outlets</a>, the protesters are \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cextremists\u201d bent on staging a coup d\u2019état, and the West must stop encouraging the activists and meddling in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-loan-ukraine-postpone-401/">has floated</a> the idea of delaying the latest $2-billion tranche of Russia\u2019s economy-sustaining, $15-billion loan package to Ukraine, possibly as a less-than-subtle reminder that Yanukovych better not compromise with the protesters.</p> <p>The longer Ukraine\u2019s political crisis continues, though, the greater the chance that it will disintegrate into something far worse. The government wants the protesters gone, full stop\u2014cleared from Kiev\u2019s Independence Square (<em>Maidan Nezalezhnosti)</em> and the administrative buildings they\u2019ve occupied outside the capital. The activists know they need results above all else, and some have been willing to resort to violence to break the political deadlock. Fighting could intensify in the capital and spread beyond it.</p> <p>The risk of full-scale conflict is still remote. But it is real. The country\u2019s first president, Leonid Kravchuk, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25939737">sounded</a> the alarm last week, saying the country was on \u201cthe brink of civil war.\u201d And the military brass <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/ukraine-army-calls-president-take-urgent-steps-ease-crisis-20140131">recently called</a> on the president, in his capacity as \u201ccommander-in-chief,\u201d to take \u201curgent steps\u201d to bring stability to the country. This week, as talks between the president and the opposition sputtered, protest leader Vitali Klitschko <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-02-03/ukrainian-opposition-pushes-for-vote-to-curb-presidential-powers">warned</a> that stalled progress could spur \u201cradical actions,\u201d while the leader of a fringe, far-right militant group <a href="http://world.time.com/2014/02/04/ukraine-dmitri-yarosh-kiev/">pledged</a> to oppose the government by armed struggle if necessary.</p> <figure><img alt="" height="365" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/02/RTX16MB9/26d809912.jpg" width="570" /><figcaption class="caption">Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, left, winks at Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, during a summit on December 17. (Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p>The second option, a national-unity government, could ratchet down the current tension several notches, but it wouldn\u2019t remove it. The frustrated and now increasingly aggressive protesters on the Maidan want one thing: Yanukovych\u2019s disappearance from the political arena. They won\u2019t accept any solution short of that\u2014and won\u2019t leave the square until they\u2019re satisfied.</p> <p>Which brings us to the last scenario: Yanukovych steps down, peacefully, and the opposition assumes power. While this development would defuse the conflict to a degree, it too would not resolve Ukraine\u2019s crisis. Political divisions, both within the country and the protest camp itself, will remain, and possibly become more pronounced.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s Euromaidan protest movement, like many mass political uprisings before it, has united <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/what-europe-means-to-ukraines-protesters/282327/">disparate groups and people</a> by necessity, and what happens when the object of their loathing is vanquished is anyone\u2019s guess. The three opposition politicians leading the movement\u2014all of whom have an eye on presidential elections\u2014whenever these take place\u2014are divided and unable to agree on who the supreme commander is. The Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party\u2014which is headed by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a savvy political strategist who looks like a CPA, while former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, the actual leader, remains in jail\u2014has always considered itself the primus inter pares. Yatsenyuk is less charismatic than Vitali Klitschko, the boxer-turned-politician who heads the Udar (Punch) party, but he seems unwilling to yield the top position to the more popular Klitschko, who is the most likely to defeat Yanukovych in a head-to-head contest, according to <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/poll-yanukovych-to-lose-to-opposition-candidates-in-second-round-of-presidential-elections-334239.html">recent polling</a>.</p> <p>Rounding out the triumvirate is Oleh Tyahnybok, the far-right leader, who, while the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBiFA0T4nsw">most electrifying politician</a> of the lot, is an ideological outlier. His Svoboda (Freedom) party has recently made efforts to become more mainstream; nevertheless, large portions of Ukrainian society reject his brand of extreme Ukrainian nationalism, viewing the party platform as far too radical and ethnocentric (or even racist). So far, protest leaders have been unable or unwilling to control their extremist wing. As a whole, Euromaidan supporters are emphatically not the Ukrainian-speaking proto-fascists they\u2019ve been portrayed as in pro-government and Russian media. Nevertheless, the far-right is a key contributor to these protests, and one that is increasingly demanding a more prominent political role.</p> <p>And although Ukraine has made huge progress in overcoming its divisions (which are geographic, linguistic, historical, and economic), it still often looks like two separate countries. Despite the protests\u2019 recent spread to the industrial, Russian-leaning, Russian-speaking east and south, Euromaidan remains predominately a phenomenon of the country\u2019s west and center\u2014and its leadership has done practically nothing to address this divide.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, some of the symbols and slogans the opposition has adopted <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gBHjfAQv2TNRUvdReO5m_Zl0LGyQ?docId=57e7f842-6575-423d-ac4e-26535d83cf01">are associated with</a> the western-based Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which during World War II was allied with Nazi Germany (though it also fought the Germans at one point) and battled Soviet forces. The prevalent Euromaidan battle cry, \u201c<em>Slava Ukraini</em>!\u201d (Glory to Ukraine!) and black-and-red flag, seen everywhere on Independence Square, originated with the UPA. All this has repulsed Ukrainians whose fathers and grandfathers fought against the UPA.</p> <p>If the opposition prevails over Yanukovych, they will still have to bridge these rifts. And Ukraine\u2019s easterners and southerners, who up to now have been quiescent, may begin to voice their discontent.</p> <p>So for those who have found the ongoing political standoff in Ukraine to be gripping theater, good news: The show is likely to go on for a long time. But for those actually caught up in the maelstrom, the future appears grim indeed.</p> <p>As the opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk put it at a recent rally, in a moment of bravado that has perhaps since passed,  \u201cWe will go forward together. And if it\u2019s a bullet in the forehead, then it\u2019s a bullet in the forehead.\u201d</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c0db93/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fukraines-forever-revolution%2F283615%2F&amp;t=Ukraine%27s+Forever+Revolution" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fukraines-forever-revolution%2F283615%2F&amp;t=Ukraine%27s+Forever+Revolution" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fukraines-forever-revolution%2F283615%2F&amp;t=Ukraine%27s+Forever+Revolution" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fukraines-forever-revolution%2F283615%2F&amp;t=Ukraine%27s+Forever+Revolution" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fukraines-forever-revolution%2F283615%2F&amp;t=Ukraine%27s+Forever+Revolution" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530209486/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0db93/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/D_sp-cXIMoM" width="1" />

Obama quickly initiated evasive maneuvers. \u201cIn a lot of ways, Richard Nixon was more\u2014more liberal than I was,\u201d the president replied, before insisting that \u201cI tend not to think about these things in terms of liberal and Democrat\u2014or liberal and conservative\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always this way. In the first half of the 20th century, \u201cliberal\u201d enjoyed a certain prestige. When Franklin Roosevelt began using it to describe the ideology of the New Deal, for instance, small-government types accused him of linguistic theft, claiming that since the expansion of state power threatened liberty, they\u2014and not the New Dealers\u2014were the true liberals.</p> <p>But by the 1960s, the American right had stopped claiming \u201cliberal\u201d and begun demonizing it. Over the next two decades, being a liberal came to mean letting criminals terrorize America\u2019s cities, hippies undermine traditional morality, and communists menace the world. It meant, in other words, too much liberty for the wrong kind of people. Fearful of its negative connotations, Democratic politicians began disassociating themselves from the term, and as the Obama interview showed, they still do.</p> <p>But that political logic may be out of date. \u201cLiberal\u201d became a dirty word at a time of soaring crime, when Democrats came under attack for allegedly prioritizing the rights of criminals over the safety of everyone else. Today, crime has dropped so dramatically that even prominent Republicans advocate less punitive sentencing. The decline of \u201cliberal\u201d into epithet status also coincided with a cultural revolt, especially on sexual issues like abortion and gay rights, which frightened many middle-aged Americans. But today, the people demanding greater cultural liberty\u2014whether they be gay couples wanting to marry or individuals wanting to legally smoke pot\u2014don\u2019t seem nearly as radical. Finally, \u201cliberal\u201d grew associated with weakness during a humiliating phase in American foreign policy: when America\u2019s defeat in Vietnam and the Iran hostage crisis dealt painful blows to national pride. In the post-Iraq era, by contrast, Republican efforts to out-hawk Obama on foreign policy have utterly failed.</p> <p>\u201cLiberal,\u201d in other words, got its bad name because of a series of racial, sexual, and global bogeymen that don\u2019t frighten Americans nearly as much anymore.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean Americans now love the term. Although the percentage of Americans calling themselves \u201cliberal\u201d has risen in recent years, liberal self-identification still trails conservative self-identification, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166787/liberal-self-identification-edges-new-high-2013.aspx">in the most recent Gallup poll</a>, by 15 points.</p> <p>But there\u2019s reason to believe that today, many Americans eschew the term not because they associate it with any particular unpopular attitudes or issue positions, but merely because they\u2019ve only heard it discussed negatively. In a <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/files/polisci/imce/claasen_tucker_smith_spsa.pdf">thought-provoking 2013 paper</a>, Christopher Claassen, Patrick Tucker, and Steven S. Smith of Washington University in St. Louis note that although most Americans prefer the term \u201cconservative,\u201d those same Americans are \u201cremarkably consistent\u201d in telling researchers that they prefer liberal policies. How come? One reason may be that \u201cconservative\u201d has positive \u201cextra-political\u201d associations. To many Americans, it connotes \u201ccaution, restraint and respect for traditional values,\u201d positive attributes irrespective of one\u2019s views on specific policies.</p> <p>But even more important, Claassen, Tucker, and Smith suggest, may be the negative way in which \u201cliberal\u201d is publicly discussed. \u201cWhen certain labels are emphasized or favored by political and media elites,\u201d they write, \u201cthe public is more likely to identify with them than others. Public framing often promotes the term \u2018conservative,\u2019 while the term \u2018liberal\u2019 is used with much less frequency and has long had a more negative connotation.\u201d Part of the reason Americans consider liberal an epithet, in other words, is because they mostly hear it used as an epithet.</p> <p>When Obama disavows the term, he perpetuates that dynamic and allows conservatives like O\u2019Reilly to continue tarring Democrats with a label most Americans consider negative, even if they\u2019re no longer entirely sure why. It might be wiser, at least in the long-term, to explain why the specific policies many Americans support <em>are liberal</em>. And thus begin to reclaim the term.</p> <p>When political attitudes change, so can the connotations of political words. Think about \u201cqueer,\u201d which is now used largely positively\u2014partly because Americans are more supportive of LGBT rights, but also because activists embraced it as a term of pride. The same thing could happen to \u201cliberal,\u201d if only liberals like Obama didn\u2019t head for the hills every time conservatives like O\u2019Reilly bring it up.</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fliberal-is-good%2F283617%2F&amp;t=%27Liberal%27+Is+Good" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fliberal-is-good%2F283617%2F&amp;t=%27Liberal%27+Is+Good" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fliberal-is-good%2F283617%2F&amp;t=%27Liberal%27+Is+Good" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fliberal-is-good%2F283617%2F&amp;t=%27Liberal%27+Is+Good" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fliberal-is-good%2F283617%2F&amp;t=%27Liberal%27+Is+Good" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530264962/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c08fbf/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/EOROKau7oQc" width="1" />

It quantifies what so many publishers have experienced: a massive surge of traffic from Facebook, unparalleled in its regular, day-after-day size and scope.</p> <p>The graph comes <a href="http://recode.net/2014/02/02/the-year-facebook-blew-past-google/">from Peter Kafka</a>, a reporter at the tech news site <em>Recode</em>, who notices that the graph validates Buzzfeed\u2019s long-term bet that Facebook would eventually be more important than Google.</p> <p>That\u2019s true, though the graph interests me for three other reasons:</p> <p>1. The kind of traffic surge from Facebook\u2014so vertiginous to be almost hockey-stick-ish\u2014wasn\u2019t an accident. Facebook didn\u2019t grow at that rate in 2013, especially among U.S. users, and \u201cnaturally\u201d eclipse Google. As I\u2019ve written before, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/the-quiet-upheaval-of-facebooks-new-iphone-app/283477/">Facebook\u2019s directing that kind of traffic because it <em>wants</em> to direct that traffic</a>\u2014it wants to be a digital publishing kingmaker.</p> <p>2. On the web, we rarely see search engine optimized (SEO) stories anymore. That\u2019s partly because Google has gotten better at giving you the answers you want\u2014for instance, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/a-brief-history-of-what-time-is-the-super-bowl/283497/">what time the Super Bowl is</a>. But it\u2019s also because SEO journalism just doesn\u2019t make commercial sense anymore. Social trumps search, at least when it comes to the attention that sells ads.</p> <p>3. When talking about his new journalism outlet, Ezra Klein has hinted about how it might provide context through <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/qa-ezra-klein-promises-a-completely-different-product">the use of encyclopedia-like explainers</a>. Those may make good journalistic sense, and writing them may be easy for the site\u2019s reporters, helping them understand and \u201cown\u201d their beats. Another way of looking at them, though, is as an SEO play. They would be very likely to appear at the top of Google search results for certain news events. In a news world where Google can\u2019t drive the traffic it once did, does a strategy like that make sense?</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c03517/sc/21/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fand-just-like-that-facebook-became-the-most-important-entity-in-web-journalism%2F283618%2F&amp;t=And+Just+Like+That%2C+Facebook+Became+the+Most+Important+Entity+in+Web+Journalism" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fand-just-like-that-facebook-became-the-most-important-entity-in-web-journalism%2F283618%2F&amp;t=And+Just+Like+That%2C+Facebook+Became+the+Most+Important+Entity+in+Web+Journalism" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fand-just-like-that-facebook-became-the-most-important-entity-in-web-journalism%2F283618%2F&amp;t=And+Just+Like+That%2C+Facebook+Became+the+Most+Important+Entity+in+Web+Journalism" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fand-just-like-that-facebook-became-the-most-important-entity-in-web-journalism%2F283618%2F&amp;t=And+Just+Like+That%2C+Facebook+Became+the+Most+Important+Entity+in+Web+Journalism" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fand-just-like-that-facebook-became-the-most-important-entity-in-web-journalism%2F283618%2F&amp;t=And+Just+Like+That%2C+Facebook+Became+the+Most+Important+Entity+in+Web+Journalism" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530208181/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c03517/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/OKBomyMVsdU" width="1" />

They aimed at the oil-cooling systems, causing them to leak oil and eventually overheat. By the time that happened, the attackers were long gone. </p> <p>Wellinghoff toured the site with Navy Seals, according to the <em>Journal</em>, and they were convinced that it was a professional job. Several people in the <em>Journal</em> story join Wellinghoff in talking up the physical (not <em>cyber</em>) threats to the grid's stability.</p> <p>Despite the great reporting in the <em>WSJ</em> story, the<em> </em>central question remains unresolved: Why did this attack occur? What did they want? </p> <p>There are something like <a href="http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/b2b/energysupply/qualifyingfacilities/settlement/substations.pdf">1,500 substations</a> just in the regional utility PG&amp;E's network. Why this one? What makes Metcalf special? It's not especially remote. In fact, there is a housing development less than 500 feet away. (And how did those people not hear 100 rounds being fired?)</p> <p>The Metcalf facility sends power into San Jose/Silicon Valley. But it sounds as though the grid operators were able to route power around the damage in the grid fairly easily. </p> <p>Without being too Pynchonian about the whole thing, I find myself asking: What would an attack like this allow someone to do somewhere else? What else was going on in the wee hours of April 16, 2013?</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c0351b/sc/21/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsnipers-coordinated-an-attack-on-the-power-grid-but-why%2F283620%2F&amp;t=Snipers+Coordinated+an+Attack+on+the+Power+Grid%2C+but+Why%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsnipers-coordinated-an-attack-on-the-power-grid-but-why%2F283620%2F&amp;t=Snipers+Coordinated+an+Attack+on+the+Power+Grid%2C+but+Why%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsnipers-coordinated-an-attack-on-the-power-grid-but-why%2F283620%2F&amp;t=Snipers+Coordinated+an+Attack+on+the+Power+Grid%2C+but+Why%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsnipers-coordinated-an-attack-on-the-power-grid-but-why%2F283620%2F&amp;t=Snipers+Coordinated+an+Attack+on+the+Power+Grid%2C+but+Why%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsnipers-coordinated-an-attack-on-the-power-grid-but-why%2F283620%2F&amp;t=Snipers+Coordinated+an+Attack+on+the+Power+Grid%2C+but+Why%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530208180/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c0351b/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Bad64Tr3F2U" width="1" />

VThe way society is organized means that most of us don't sleep when our bodies naturally want to. A small town in Germany wants to change that.<img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c00b66/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/a2t.img" width="1" />

According to <a href="http://www.badkissingen.de/en/">the town\u2019s website</a>, Bavarian King Ludwig II bestowed the \u201cBad\u201d part of its name on it in 1883, but not because he didn\u2019t enjoy his stay\u2014\u201cbad\u201d means \u201cbath\u201d or \u201cspa\u201d in German. Just south of the Rhön Mountains in Germany, it\u2019s quaintly charming in the way of small European towns (it has a population of about 20,000), particularly those reliant on tourists.</p> <p>Apparently there\u2019s a bit of a competition among European spa towns\u2014\u201cmedical tourism\u201d brings people who want special, specific treatments, or the cheapest possible version of a treatment. So Dr. Thomas Kantermann, of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, tells me. A friend of his, Michael Wieden, is the official business developer of Bad Kissingen.</p> <p>\u201cHe joined with me to think\u2014if we want to pimp this town, if we want to make it more sexy and attractive, how can we do it?\u201d Kantermann says.</p> <p>Wieden sought Kantermann out for his particular expertise\u2014Kantermann is a chronobiologist, meaning he studies the differences in people\u2019s circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. A person\u2019s preferred sleep pattern is his or her \u201cchronotype.\u201d This is what we\u2019re talking about when we say someone is a morning person or a night owl. Research has shown that living outside your chronotype, which most of us do\u2014waking ourselves up early with an alarm clock for school or work, or staying out too late at the bars\u2014can lead to all kinds of problems other than just being tired: poor memory, depression, obesity, even a greater risk for some kinds of cancer.</p> <p>Sleep is mysterious, and we don\u2019t totally understand why we need it\u2014just that we do, and bad things happen if we don\u2019t get enough of it. On average, we spend around 30 percent of our lives asleep, but as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v6/n5/full/nrn1670.html">a review of the literature</a> on circadian rhythms from 2005 notes, \u201cThe introduction of artificial lighting and the restructuring of working hours has progressively detached our species from the 24-hour cycle of light and dark. \u2026 At best we tolerate the fact that we need to sleep, and at worst we think of sleep as an illness that needs a cure.\u201d</p> <p>Not so in Bad Kissingen.</p> <p>Though the initiative\u2019s sexiness is perhaps debatable, in an effort to stand out from the pack and improve the lives of its citizens and visitors, Bad Kissingen has committed itself to finding ways to implement chronobiology into the fabric of the town\u2019s society.</p> <p>\u201cThe history of Bad Kissingen has [always] been linked to curation and health,\u201d Wieden says. \u201cWe have 17 hospitals, sanatoriums and rehabs. We have about 250,000 guests per year. Hence, tourism and health treatment are closely linked in Bad Kissingen. Therefore, to me, Bad Kissingen is the best place in the world to start a \u2018whole city project\u2019 like this.\u201d</p> <p>Russell Foster, a professor of neuroscience at Oxford University, studies chronobiology but is not involved in the Bad Kissingen project. \u201cChanging behavior in any area is really difficult,\u201d he says, and notes <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-4-431-09423-4_24#page-1">a classic study</a> in which researchers observed a population of monkeys slowly learning to wash their food in the ocean to get the sand off. \u201cThe ones that were slowest to adopt [the washing behavior] were at the top of the social hierarchy.\u201d Similarly, if those in charge of scheduling our lives\u2014school boards, bosses, etc.\u2014aren\u2019t amenable to change, it\u2019s next to impossible to truly sleep like yourself.</p> <p>But there Bad Kissingen has the advantage of buy-in from the top. Kantermann is the project\u2019s scientific manager, and in July 2013, he, Wieden, Bad Kissingen\u2019s mayor and town council, and other researchers from the University of Groningen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich signed a letter of intent. In that letter, they pledged to promote chronobiology research in the town, to \u201cgather results that are directly applicable to living, education, work, well-being, health, mobility, rehabilitation, and sleep.\u201d It goes on to claim that \u201cthe city of Bad Kissingen will be the first in the world realizing scientific field studies in a wider context.\u201d Those involved often refer to Bad Kissingen as \u201cChronoCity.\u201d</p> <p>Though it was first conceived more than a year ago, the project is still in its infancy\u2014it takes time and careful planning to do anything on this scale. Plus, Kantermann says, they need more money.</p> <p>The goal is to get all of the town\u2019s citizens\u2019 chronotypes in an online database. Right now, individuals have to go to <a href="http://www.thewep.org/en/chronotype_study.php">this website</a> and input their own data; the hope is that one day schools and hospitals will take down this information as regularly as someone\u2019s height or weight, making it much easier to determine and work with the town\u2019s needs.</p> <p align="center">* * *</p> <p>The roots of the field of chronobiology are actually leaves. The concept was born in France in 1729, when astronomer Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan noticed that the leaves of his heliotrope plant closed and opened at the same time every day. So he enclosed the plant in a dark space, and found that the leaves continued their punctual dance, sun or no sun.</p> <p>In this way, humans are not unlike plants, as German biologist Jürgen Aschoff discovered in the 1950\u2019s. He built an underground bunker, where human subjects would stay, cut off from light, sound, and the Earth\u2019s vibrations, so they would have no way to tell what time of day it was. (He went in the bunker himself, first, before experimenting on others.) Most people still kept pretty close to a 24-hour day, though some went for 48 hours, and slept for 16. This confirmed Aschoff\u2019s earlier research (which he also did on himself) that found that that humans lose body heat in regular, 24-hour patterns. Along with U.S. biologist Colin Pittendrigh, Aschoff is considered a co-founder of the field of chronobiology. Fitting, then, that a German town should be the first to try to take chronobiology mainstream.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a quite young field actually, especially the human part,\u201d Kantermann says. \u201cIt\u2019s only 50 to 60 years old. Now we have more sophisticated sleep labs where we do it, though, [instead of] a bunker.\u201d</p> <p>Kantermann explains that the way we measure someone\u2019s chronotype now uses a metric called \u201cmid-sleep.\u201d This is the halfway point between when you fall asleep, and when you wake up. So if you go to bed at midnight, and get your recommended eight hours, waking up at 8 a.m., your mid-sleep would be 4 a.m.</p> <p>Teenagers, it is widely known, have some of the latest chronotypes around. Their mid-sleep is often as late as 6 or 7 a.m., according to Kantermann. \u201cWe have school starting at that time in Germany, at half past seven, or 8 o\u2019clock, which means these students are sitting [in class] in the middle of their biological night,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Considering teens\u2019 reliably late chronotypes, the one concrete step that Bad Kissingen has taken so far was to do a couple of studies this past summer at the local high school, looking at how light exposure affects students\u2019 chronotypes, and in turn, how their chronotypes affect their academic performance. The data is still being analyzed, so Kantermann can\u2019t discuss the results yet, but he is hopeful that the experiments will yield a way to help shift students\u2019 chronotype using light.</p> <p>It would seem that the easiest solution would be to just start school later, and studies have shown this to have real results. For example, in 1997, the Minneapolis Public School District changed its start time from 7:15 a.m. to 8:40 a.m., and a four-year <a href="http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/139295/1/2002%20NASSP%20Bulletin,%20Vol.%2086%20No.%20633.pdf">longitudinal study</a> found that students were notably less tardy, less depressed, and less sleepy during class with the later start time. And they really were getting more sleep. The data showed the students still went to bed at around the same time as they had before\u2014they weren\u2019t using the later start time as an excuse to stay up late.</p> <p>But changing the school schedule presents a whole host of logistical issues\u2014after school activities may run later, or parents may have trouble dropping kids off, especially if you don\u2019t also shift the start time for elementary and middle-schoolers, who have naturally earlier chronotypes. In Bad Kissingen specifically, Kantermann notes that many students bus in from neighboring villages, and sometimes have commutes that are an hour or two long. So they\u2019d still have to wake up pretty early.</p> <p>If changing school start time isn\u2019t possible, Kantermann suggests moving things around within the existing school structure\u2014pushing tests to the afternoon when students are more alert, or having outside physical activity in the morning to expose them to more natural light.</p> <p>These logistical issues apply to work as well. \u201cYour employer should ideally capture the time of day when you\u2019re going to be most productive,\u201d Foster says. Adult chronotypes, though, can\u2019t be as easily lumped together as late-sleeping teens. In fact, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982204009285">a 2004 study</a> (on which Till Roenneberg, of LMU Munich, who is also involved in the Bad Kissingen project, was lead author) suggested that in fact, the disappearance of this extra-late chronotype is a sign that adolescence is over.</p> <p>\u201cChildren are early chronotypes and become progressively later (delaying) during development, reaching a maximum in their \u2018lateness\u2019 at around the age of 20,\u201d the study reads. \u201cAfter 20, they become earlier again (advancing) with increasing age.\u201d</p> <p>However, if you\u2019re naturally a night owl, shedding the angsty, late-sleeping skin of your youth won\u2019t make you into a morning person. According to this study, you\u2019ll still be a night owl\u2014just less extremely.</p> <p>\u201cAn individual is likely to retain his/her chronotype\u2014in relationship to others of the same age and sex\u2014throughout life,\u201d the researchers write. Other studies corroborate this assertion that one\u2019s chronotype is at least partly genetic.</p> <p><a href="http://jbr.sagepub.com/content/18/1/80">Another Roenneberg study</a>, this one from 2003, asserts that despite our morning-oriented society, early risers are actually in the minority. This is largely to do with our dissociation from natural light. Light, the study explains, is the major <em>zeitgeber </em>for our internal clocks. <em>Zeitgeber</em> is a German word, coined by Aschoff, that means \u201ctime giver\u201d or \u201csynchronizer.\u201d Chronobiologists use it to refer to cues in the environment that synchronize our internal clocks with the Earth\u2019s 24-hour cycle.</p> <p>\u201cLater distribution of chronotypes is, at least partly, due to the absence of a strong <em>zeitgeber</em> in modern society,\u201d the study reads. Our bodies don\u2019t react as strongly to artificial light as to natural light (although, in the total absence of natural light, we\u2019ll eventually respond to mankind\u2019s bulbs), so a society built on electrical light results in more late chronotypes than one reliant on sunshine. And yet our fluorescent office culture is still geared toward early chronotypes.</p> <p>On the other side of the coin are shift workers, who, depending on their schedule, may have a sleep pattern that\u2019s completely opposite of the cycle of natural light. Though late chronotypes may have an easier time with this work schedule, night shift workers have been shown to be at greater risk for certain kinds of cancer, because disrupted sleep can impair the immune system. In Bad Kissingen, Kantermann says, shift workers are mostly health care professionals\u2014doctors, nurses, etc.\u2014people you generally want to be well-rested.</p> <p>If this sounds like a lot of problems with not a lot of solutions, well, it is. Even with the abundance of research available, there are practical problems to consider.</p> <p>\u201cThe project seems quite challenging, attempting to accommodate individuals yet maintain a societal framework,\u201d Mary Carskadon, director of chronobiology and sleep research at Bradley Hospital, and psychiatry professor at Brown University, told me in an email. \u201cI can think of a number of barriers that might arise, including occupational misfits, or challenges to family life, or unavailability of resources that might be required.\u201d</p> <p>Foster also expressed concern that enthusiasm for sleep-improving projects tends to peter out over time, that people just don\u2019t take the importance of sleep seriously, and efforts aren\u2019t sustainable. But he praised the questionnaire Kantermann et. al are using to measure chronotypes, saying they already have the data of \u201ctens of thousands of people all across Europe,\u201d enough data to be able to analyze it and make generalizations about populations.</p> <p>The signers of the letter of intent pledged to meet five times a year to talk about how things are progressing\u2014Kantermann says their next meeting will probably be in March, and he\u2019s just glad people keep coming back; that, so far, interest hasn\u2019t petered out on a project that, by its nature, is a bit of a long game.</p> <p>The next step, Kantermann says, is to experiment with the lighting in local clinics, hotels, and possibly even the town hall. The ChronoCity project is partnering with lighting companies to help make that possible. \u201cWe have to just manipulate a bit here and there,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we change too much, you will see an effect, but then it\u2019s hard to determine what happened, so we have to be careful that we don\u2019t change too much.\u201d</p> <p>Though they\u2019re currently taking small bites out of this whale of a project, Kantermann is dreaming big.</p> <p>\u201cMy great aim for this town is to make Bad Kissingen the first town in Germany that abolishes Daylight Savings Time,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the people can decide for themselves to change their clocks or not\u2026 To make this really a place where your internal time is acknowledged.\u201d</p> <p>In a hypothetical future world where Bad Kissingen succeeds in letting all of its citizens and visitors live out their chronotypes, the societal benefits would be huge. The town as a whole would be more creative, happier, and more alert. Social interaction would improve, as would the population\u2019s ability to problem-solve. Chronically tired people often struggle with obesity, immune suppression, and mental illness, so the town\u2019s overall health\u2014both mental and physical\u2014would improve.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe this village will ultimately change its behavior,\u201d Foster says. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t been tried before, so they\u2019ll learn the best way of keeping the town on board. Thomas [Kantermann] is very good at interacting with people, so if anybody can do this, I suspect he will be able to.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Bad Kissingen will be the sleep equivalent of the first monkey to wash its food\u2014a harbinger of societal change to come.</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36c00b66/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-town-thats-building-life-around-sleep%2F283553%2F&amp;t=The+Town+That%27s+Building+Life+Around+Sleep" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/187557438502/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36c00b66/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/-J1RKVzqJms" width="1" />

(Jim Young/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p><span>CVS/Caremark announced this morning that it will stop selling tobacco products starting October 1. </span></p> <p>The pharmacy chain said selling cancer-causing products was incompatible with its overall mission of improving health, both through its pharmacies and its MinuteClinic walk-in primary care centers. The company will forgo $2 billion in annual tobacco sales by no longer carrying the number-one cause of preventable death. </p> <p><span>\u201cWe have about 26,000 pharmacists and nurse practitioners helping patients manage chronic problems like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease, all of which are linked to smoking,\u201d Larry J. Merlo, chief executive of CVS, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/business/cvs-plans-to-end-sales-of-tobacco-products-by-october.html?hp&amp;_r=0">told the <em>New York Times</em></a>. \u201cWe came to the decision that cigarettes and providing healthcare just don\u2019t go together in the same setting.\u201d</span></p> <p>CVS's 800 MinuteClinics are the country's largest provider of retail health care, and its staff does everything from writing prescriptions to providing vaccinations. The company's decision reveals the tension many retailers who provide medical services are likely to face as primary care increasingly spreads to supermarkets, drop-in centers, and other unconventional locations.</p> <p>As more Americans gain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/america-is-running-out-of-doctors-20131104">general practitioners grow increasingly scarce</a>, retail clinics are expected to play a larger role in preventative and primary care. There are roughly <a href="http://www.merchantmedicine.com/home.cfm">1,600 retail clinics</a> in the U.S., with CVS's MinuteClinics making up the bulk of them.</p> <p>Last summer, the consulting firm <a href="http://www.uhc.com/live/uhc_com/Assets/Documents/Accenture_RetailHealthClinics.pdf">Accenture predicted </a>that the number of retail clinics would grow 20 to 30 percent each year for the next three years, driven in part by partnerships and referrals from hospital emergency rooms and overburdened primary care practices. Rand <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP20100123.html">estimated that up to</a> a quarter<span> of all emergency department visits could instead be handled by a retail or drop-in clinic.</span></p> <figure class="right"><img alt="" height="219" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/02/Screen_Shot_2014_02_05_at_9.41.28_AM/9b27fe8a0.png" width="370" /><figcaption class="credit">Merchant Medicine</figcaption></figure><p>CVS is far from the only player in the retail-clinic space: <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/topic/pharmacy/healthcare-clinic.jsp">Walgreens</a>,<a href="http://www.target.com/pharmacy/clinic-home"> Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.stvincenthealth.com/theclinicatwalmart/">Walmart</a> all have their own versions. And as more and more big-box stores become homes for primary care, they may face identity crises because they sell the vice-oriented products that make consumers feel good alongside the services that make them well. Even as CVS stops offering cigarettes within 20 feet of a physician assistant's practice, its competitors might continue to do so. And beyond tobacco, Walmart might encounter PR issues over the fact that it sells, say, Jack Daniels and cirrhosis treatments under one roof, or shot guns and wound care. Some states have even considered legislation that would <a href="http://www.health.ny.gov/facilities/public_health_and_health_planning_council/meetings/2013-09-13/docs/rc_background_paper.pdf">prevent retail clinics</a> from operating in stores that sell tobacco or alcohol. </p> <p>Walmart and Walgreens so far haven't said they'd follow CVS's lead.

Dylan Farrow <a href="http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;">says</a> her father led her into an attic room and sexually molested her. Allen insists he\u2019s innocent. His supporters\u2014including his friend and documentarian Robert B. Weide, who defended him in <em><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/27/the-woody-allen-allegations-not-so-fast.html">The Daily Beast</a></em> last weekend\u2014argue that a review of the evidence may even suggest that Farrow\u2019s mother planted false memories in her mind. Meanwhile, publications like <em><a href="http://jezebel.com/what-we-should-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-the-dylan-1514959143">Jezebel</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/03/the_uneasy_ambiguity_of_the_woody_allen_case/">Salon</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116466/woody-allen-abuse-allegations-brings-out-worst-online-media">The New Republic</a></em> have tried to take a balanced perspective, reminding readers that the truth is unknowable.</p> <p>Yet there is something inherently imbalanced about a child abuse case. The very secrecy that makes the truth \u201cunknowable\u201d is an instrument of the crime. With no witnesses or credible legal evidence, the \u201che said/she said\u201d conundrum prevails. The assailant knows this, and he can use it to his advantage. As soon as children make allegations, they enter a world filled with adult concepts\u2014ideas they themselves don\u2019t entirely understand. In order to even tell their stories, they have to learn a new language, putting vague, undefined feelings into unfamiliar words. The whole drama plays out in a grown-up context, which means the grown-up always has the upper hand. Neutrality never even has a chance.</p> <p>I know this from personal experience. When I was 8 years old, I was molested by a much older cousin while he was babysitting. He spent hours taunting me and my 5-year-old sister, threatening that if we didn\u2019t behave he\u2019d unzip his pants. Then he led me into the bathroom while my sister watched TV. He fastened the latch on the door, which was higher than I could reach, and ridiculed me when I didn\u2019t want to do the things he told me to. So I did them . He kept me there with him, locked in the bathroom, until it was time for bed.</p> <p>But he and I are the only people in the world who know for sure what happened. I can\u2019t prove a single word of it, and my cousin was never charged with a crime. I am grateful that my parents took the situation so seriously, and I haven\u2019t seen him since. Like Woody Allen, he moved on. He has a house, a wife, and a kid.</p> <p>As so many writers have reminded us, Allen is not a convicted criminal. Even Nicholas Kristof emphasized this in his introduction to Farrow\u2019s February 1 letter: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that Woody Allen was never prosecuted in this case and has consistently denied wrongdoing; he deserves the presumption of innocence.\u201d And Allen\u2019s defenders continue to remind the public that an independent investigation by a Yale medical team found no reason to conclude the charges were true. Furthermore, they insist, Dylan\u2019s stories were inconsistent and rehearsed.</p> <p>The problem is that if young victims can be dismissed for sounding inconsistent and rehearsed, then the whole game is rigged from the beginning.</p> <p>Farrow says that when she first told her mother what Allen had done, she \u201cdidn\u2019t know the firestorm it would trigger.\u201d That was my experience as well. In fact, it was my little sister who brought the story to light\u2014when she asked my parents if they\u2019d ever heard my cousin threatening  to unzip his pants, I was angry at her for acting like a little kid. I thought keeping quiet meant I was acting like an adult. I bought into my cousin\u2019s cool teenage cachet; although I felt wrong about what had happened, I assumed the problem was me.</p> <p>When my alarmed parents sat me down to draw out every detail of what had happened, trying to construct a timeline and zeroing in on specific actions and body parts, I was terrified by their seriousness. The conversation was such an important one that we had it sitting right where we were when my sister brought up the subject: on the stairs. It\u2019s hard to give an accurate account of something when you\u2019re under that kind of strange pressure\u2014when the facts are suddenly so palpably urgent that you can\u2019t even move to a chair. The seeds of \u201cnarrative inconsistency\u201d are planted right then, before you even know why the story matters.</p> <p>This is why amassing evidence in childhood sexual assault cases is a dirty game. My parents filed a police report a few days after the incident, and I was questioned by a state investigator. She came to my school one morning, pulling me out of class for some fabricated reason that struck me even then as bogus. I remember sitting there with her for a long time. When she steered the conversation toward the investigation, she started to ask if I knew the clinical words for my private parts. She very carefully explained that there were no wrong answers, and that I was not in trouble. But I phrased my answers in a way that would deflect follow-up. I was acutely aware that I was the only person in my class who had to do this, and that the game of \u201cHeads Up, Seven Up\u201d I was missing was probably a lot more fun.</p> <p>After I'd spoken with investigators and my parents, I am sure my account sounded just as rehearsed as Dylan Farrow's. The story was mine, but the words were new to me. I had to internalize a context and vocabulary based on the way adults interacted with my story. I had to learn which details were the most important. In short, I was pushed through an intensive course on a daunting topic very, very quickly. If this was also Dylan Farrow\u2019s experience\u2014 if her mother also had to teach her what all of this meant and why it was serious\u2014then that was a very different thing from being \u201ccoached.\u201d</p> <p>My parents chose not to torment me by moving forward with criminal charges, and we probably never had a case. But 19 years later, I know two things. I know that all of it absolutely happened\u2014 and I know that there is absolutely nothing I can do to prove that I was not a confused kid who invented a convoluted story.</p> <p>You might sense that I\u2019m biased toward believing Dylan Farrow. You\u2019d be right. Her letter was so strikingly familiar\u2014 right down to the dutiful storytelling interrupted by clinical gloss-overs\u2014 that I find it difficult not to believe her. But I also know that if Woody Allen had gone to trial and I were on the jury, I would have declared him not guilty. Chances are, the other jurors would have found him not guilty, too. Crime and law are grown-up games, and they need to be played according to grown-up rules.</p> <p>But the fact that we will never know what really happened in this case does not make me feel neutral. It makes me feel furious. The entire legal paradigm favors adults. Whether or not Woody Allen abused Dylan Farrow, untold numbers of  children are sexually abused. And in an overwhelming number of cases, the adults responsible could never be found guilty in any court of law. The deck is stacked against victims from the start. Which, of course, is exactly what their abusers count on in the first place.</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fwhy-young-sexual-assault-victims-tell-incoherent-stories%2F283613%2F&amp;t=Why+Young+Sexual+Assault+Victims+Tell+Incoherent+Stories" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fwhy-young-sexual-assault-victims-tell-incoherent-stories%2F283613%2F&amp;t=Why+Young+Sexual+Assault+Victims+Tell+Incoherent+Stories" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fwhy-young-sexual-assault-victims-tell-incoherent-stories%2F283613%2F&amp;t=Why+Young+Sexual+Assault+Victims+Tell+Incoherent+Stories" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fwhy-young-sexual-assault-victims-tell-incoherent-stories%2F283613%2F&amp;t=Why+Young+Sexual+Assault+Victims+Tell+Incoherent+Stories" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fwhy-young-sexual-assault-victims-tell-incoherent-stories%2F283613%2F&amp;t=Why+Young+Sexual+Assault+Victims+Tell+Incoherent+Stories" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/sc/8/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/187557436675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf87ab/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/2UGzmvB2zAM" width="1" />

Shooting for 19 minutes, they surgically knocked out 17 giant transformers that funnel power to Silicon Valley. A minute before a police car arrived, the shooters disappeared into the night... </p> <p><span>'This wasn't an incident where Billy-Bob and Joe decided, after a few brewskis, to come in and shoot up a substation,' Mark Johnson, retired vice president of transmission for PG&amp;E, told the utility security conference, according to a video of his presentation. 'This was an event that was well thought out, well planned and they targeted certain components.'"</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/issues/105-1309/letter-from/1165-glaciers-ice-patches-norway-global-warming">Warming in the northern latitudes gives archaeologists lots of new material. But the speed of the climate change challenges their ability to preserve it</a>. </strong></p> <p>"The fortuitous discovery of the Bronze Age shoe helped the local heritage management office push for an organized rescue program to locate, assess, and search dozens of sites in the mountains of Oppland. It\u2019s an effort that combines archaeology with high-tech mapping, glaciology, climate science, and history. When conditions are right, it\u2019s as simple as picking the past up off the ground. 'The ice is a time machine,' says Lars Pilö, an archaeologist who works for the Oppland County council. 'When you\u2019re really lucky, the artifacts are exposed for the first time since they were lost.'</p> <p>In Scandinavia and beyond, the booming field of glacier and ice patch archaeology represents both an opportunity and a crisis. On one hand, it exposes artifacts and sites that have been preserved in ice for millennia, offering archaeologists a chance to study them. On the other hand, from the moment the ice at such sites melts, the pressure to find, document, and conserve the exposed artifacts is tremendous. 'The next 50 years will be decisive,' says Albert Hafner, an archaeologist at the University of Bern who has excavated melting sites in the Alps. 'If you don\u2019t do it now they will be lost.'</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/524011/why-the-promise-of-cheap-fuel-from-super-bugs-fell-short/">Despite their ambitions to displace fossil fuels, synthetic biology companies have failed to scale up</a>. </strong></p> <p>"LS9 is one of several companies founded on the premise that synthetic biology\u2014advanced genetic engineering that radically changes the way an organism functions\u2014could be used to make new strains of bacteria and yeast that would produce not just the common biofuels ethanol and biodiesel but also hydrocarbon fuels that are nearly identical to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Such fuels could be used more widely than existing biofuels, which typically need to be blended with conventional fuels or require special infrastructure.</p> <p>But synthetic-biology companies have struggled to develop organisms that can make fuels at costs that can compete with oil, and they\u2019ve yet to produce fuel at a large scale. Like LS9, many companies that set off to tap the gigantic markets for biofuels have pivoted toward chemicals, which command higher prices. (Breaking into these markets isn\u2019t likely to be easy, however\u2014they often require very high quality products, and new entrants face stiff competition from large petrochemical companies.)"</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.malignant.us/index.htm/Q%26A.html">An anthropologist explores cancer culture</a>.</strong></p> <p>"<span>Despite the ways that cancer is being produced and lived and treated, cancer culture encourages us to see those with cancer as \u201cbrave survivors\u201d engaged in epic, individual battles for their lives. I wrote the book because I wanted to better understand these paradoxes, ones I was seeing everywhere in cancer culture. Ultimately, I came to understand the ways that cancer is actually a central aspect of American economic, social, and political life. This fact is very difficult to see, because the languages we use to discuss cancer tend to frame it as a disease outside of our culture to be fought off, or as a disease we are in the midst of curing, or as a tragic exception to the natural life course rather than as a predictable result of the ways we understand and deal with our environments.  I wrote the book to better understand how this happens, and this limits our ability to see how cancer is caused and treated, and to provide a more accurate description of the role of cancer in American lives and cultures."</span></p> <p> </p> <figure><img alt="" height="319" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/02/heygoat/466545749.jpg" width="570" /></figure><p><strong>5. <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-internet-has-spoken-can-has-more-goats-pls">Finally, a goat simulator</a>. </strong></p> <p>"Goat Simulator, created by the Swedish-based <a href="http://www.coffeestainstudios.com/">Coffee Stain Studios</a>, is simple: you run around and climb things as, well, a goat. You also get points for destroying objects like barrels, tables and dinnerware, and head-butting buckets at humans with the force of a sniper rifle.

V<div class="scalable-video"></div><p> The John J. Moran Prison in Rhode Island is one of the last places one would expect to find a thriving meditative community. \u201cWe have everybody here,\u201d says Roberta Richman of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. \u201cMurderers, Rapists, sex offenders, drug addicts\u2014everybody.\u201d But with the help of Fleet Maull, a former inmate who served 14 years for drug trafficking, some prisoners are experiencing a spiritual awakening that seems to help them cope with life behind bars, and life after prison.</p> <p> In this short film from Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee we go inside the Rhode Island correctional facility, where we are introduced to Fleet Maull and the inmates who enroll in his Prison Mindfulness Institute. The film makes the case for prison serving the function of reformation and not simply incarceration.</p> <p> <em>To see more work by Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee visit <a href="http://goprojectfilms.com">goprojectfilms.com</a>, or visit his <a href="https://www.globalonenessproject.org/">Global Oneness Project</a>.</em></p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fvideo%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-meditation-can-help-inmates%2F283588%2F&amp;t=How+Meditation+Can+Help+Inmates" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fvideo%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-meditation-can-help-inmates%2F283588%2F&amp;t=How+Meditation+Can+Help+Inmates" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fvideo%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-meditation-can-help-inmates%2F283588%2F&amp;t=How+Meditation+Can+Help+Inmates" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fvideo%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-meditation-can-help-inmates%2F283588%2F&amp;t=How+Meditation+Can+Help+Inmates" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fvideo%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-meditation-can-help-inmates%2F283588%2F&amp;t=How+Meditation+Can+Help+Inmates" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/sc/22/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530204926/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bfa60f/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/cC7sluMn5NM" width="1" />

VLate last year, students at several of the city's high-performing charters staged large-scale protests. A local teacher explores why this happened.<img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/a2t.img" width="1" />

The charter operator\u2019s flagship school, Sci Academy, <a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2010/11/sci_academy_a_bright_spot_in_t.html">boasts</a> the best test scores of any open-enrollment high school in the city\u2019s Recovery School District. In 2010, Oprah <a href="http://www.wwltv.com/news/NO-school-gets-1-million-from-Oprah-donation-called-a-model-for-charter-schools.html">cut</a> the school a $1 million check.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>But this past November, a chain of events started that calls into question whether Collegiate Academies\u2014and other New Orleans charters with similar models\u2014will be able to maintain their success long-term.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>First, students at Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, another New Orleans school, <a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2013/11/clark_high_school_students_pro.html">staged a sit-in</a> after a beloved teacher was abruptly fired. The protest shut down junior classes for a day and got the following school day canceled while administrators decided how to respond. Leaders at Clark's charter operator, Firstline Schools, met with angry students and parents, agreed to give students a voice in hiring decisions, and reassigned the school's principal to the network office.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>Days later, almost 100 students at two Collegiate Academies schools <a href="http://www.wwltv.com/news/Carver-Collegiate-Academy-protest-school-conditions-stern-discipline--232692271.html">walked out</a>. The next day, about 20 of them walked out again and staged a protest in front of their schools. They said they wanted to draw attention to what they believe are unfair discipline policies. The following month, students rallied at a nearby park after school, then walked to a school board meeting where they attempted to present the board with <a href="http://media.nola.com/education_impact/other/Carver%20Students%20Demand%20Letter%20(2).pdf">a list of grievances</a> that ranged from academics ("We have no textbooks to review when we study") to discipline ("We get disciplined for anything and everything") to food service ("We want hot meals and healthy food with taste").</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>What\u2019s going on? Why the backlash against schools that are trying (and in many cases succeeding) to improve education in New Orleans? I believe the answer lies in disciplinary policies that leave students and families feeling that they are at odds with teachers and administrators. But as a teacher at a high-performing New Orleans charter school with a discipline policy that focuses on in-school consequences and positive incentives, I think it's possible to have strong achievement without oppressive discipline. </span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>Charter schools in New Orleans have made measurable academic gains in the years since Hurricane Katrina. Test scores and graduation rates are climbing. The percentage of Recovery School District 3rd through 8th graders who passed the state's annual standardized test <a href="http://www.rsdla.net/apps/news/show_news.jsp?REC_ID=273983&amp;id=0">grew</a> to 57 percent in 2013 from 51 percent the year before\u2014and 28 percent in 2008. At the high-school level, New Orleans' graduation rate <a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2013/04/state_posts_record-high_gradua.html">has surpassed</a> the state's, growing from 54.4 percent in 2004 to 77.8 percent in 2012.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>But many of the charter schools that have made these improvements rely on rigid discipline policies that can sometimes feel at odds with the city\u2019s culture. In a city known for second lines\u2014freewheeling street parades that feature brass bands, costumed dancers, and whoever else cares to join\u2014it's common for schools to put tape lines on the floor and expect students\u2014including middle- and high-schoolers\u2014to walk in silent, single-file lines at all times. Many schools have strictly enforced policies on how students sit at their desks, how they raise their hands, and how they greet teachers in the morning.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>At a time when the Obama administration is urging schools to treat suspensions "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/how-to-discipline-students-without-turning-school-into-a-prison/282944/">as a last resort</a>," 11 New Orleans charter schools </span>(including the three Collegiate schools)<span> <a href="http://media.nola.com/education_impact/photo/chart-school-suspensionsjpg-6eb4b1c8c41a50c9.jpg">suspended </a>at least a quarter of their student body during the last school year.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>The tension is especially acute in high schools, which, with their marching bands, drill teams, and football squads, have long been a source of tremendous community pride. Neighborhoods turn out to watch their schools' dancers and drumlines in Mardi Gras parades, and high school homecomings receive a month of coverage in the </span><em><span>Times-Picayune </span></em><span>every fall.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>When these sources of community identity are transformed, sometimes both rapidly and radically, by outside organizations, tensions can flare.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>Carver and Clark were both once-proud high schools that struggled after Katrina and have been taken over by charter operators in the last several years. Some families see the schools\u2019 new operators\u2019 emphasis on rigid discipline and college- prep-at-all-costs as both foreign to the city and unfair to students.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>"School is supposed to be fun sometimes," said Bianca Johnson, a mother who recently withdrew her ninth-grade son from Carver Prep, a Collegiate Academies school. "But they have them in, like, a military boot camp, and they're not giving them the chance to do something they love... It got to the point that he wasn't motivated to learn anymore."</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>My experience in New Orleans charter schools convinces me that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. It\u2019s possible to maintain high standards for both academics and behavior without rejecting the creativity and spirit of celebration that make New Orleans unique. Across the city, there are schools that have improved academic outcomes for their students without resorting to harsh disciplinary policies, while intentionally celebrating some aspects of life in New Orleans.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>At Success Preparatory Academy in the Treme, hallways are named after "hometown heroes" like chef John Besh, educational pioneer Ruby Bridges, and musician Irvin Mayfield. The Grammy award-winning Mayfield recently performed at Success while kindergarteners danced around the library.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>At the elementary school where I teach, kids have an extended school day (7:45 am to 4:00 pm) for academics, but it\u2019s not all work and no play. We celebrated Halloween with a bounce house in the school parking lot, and kids changed into costumes and trick-or-treated in the French Quarter. Come Mardi Gras, they\u2019ll take to the streets for a parade featuring the school\u2019s music classes and costumes they will have spent the last two months creating in art class.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>Still, 71 percent of our students passed their state tests last year, and many of those who didn\u2019t (often, students who started the school year several grade levels behind) were deemed by the state to have made "significant progress."</span></span></p> <!-- START "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --> <!-- END "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p dir="ltr"><span><span>I\u2019ve worked at New Orleans schools where the attitude was, "These kids are too far behind for extracurriculars." But at my current school, administrators believe that the arts\u2019 emphasis on creativity and self-expression is a critical component of any student\u2019s education. Classes like art and music are referred to as "integrals" rather than "extracurriculars." And they offer students a chance not just to express themselves, but to connect with the culture of the city. The third- and fourth-graders could take twirling last semester; the middle schoolers can join a jazz band.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr">The schools where students are protesting have the <a href="http://media.nola.com/education_impact/photo/chart-school-suspensionsjpg-6eb4b1c8c41a50c9.jpg">highest suspension rates in the city</a>. Carver Collegiate sent home 69 percent of their students at least once last school year; at Carver Prep it was 61 percent and at Clark 46 percent.Most importantly, discipline at my school is focused on in-school consequences rather than out-of-school ones. Suspensions are rare and are given only for episodes that are physically dangerous to other teachers or students.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>Collegiate students report being suspended "for every little thing." "We get disciplined for anything and everything," they </span><a href="http://media.nola.com/education_impact/other/Carver%20Students%20Demand%20Letter%20(2).pdf"><span>wrote in November</span></a><span>. "We get detentions or suspensions for not walking on the taped lines in the hallway, for slouching, for not raising our hands in a straight line."</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr">When I asked Collegiate Academies president Morgan Ripski about the school's discipline policies, she wrote in an e-mail, "<span><span>Our mission to prepare all scholars for college success is ambitious, so every minute of our school day and year are needed to teach necessary knowledge and skills."  She said the schools aim to be "fun, loving, safe, structured places."</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>But some community members say the schools\u2019 emphasis on structure overshadows its other goals. </span></span>"It feels like a highly punitive environment," said Eden Heilman, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, who has worked with some of the protesting students. She doesn\u2019t think teachers are ill- intentioned, just unaware of\u2014or unprepared to deal with\u2014some of the challenges their students face.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>"You have youths that are bringing a lot of baggage to school every day, and they\u2019re not being given an opportunity to have a bad day," Heilman said. </span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>Collegiate Academies CEO Benjamin Marcovitz </span><a href="http://media.nola.com/education_impact/other/Collegiate%20Academies%20Open%20Letter_12.20.13.pdf"><span>wrote in an open letter</span></a><span> published in the </span><em><span>Times-Picayune </span></em><span>that in the schools' discipline systems, "rewards and praise occur far more frequently than penalties." But the protests of the last few months seem to indicate that, at least for some families, frequent "shout-out meetings" aren't enough to compensate for frequent suspensions.</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span>New Orleans charter schools have proven that they can raise test scores. But if they're truly going to take root in the community and do decades\u2019 worth of long-term good, they are going to have to establish discipline policies that recognize where their students are coming from, and embrace the culture of the communities they\u2019re trying to serve.</span></span></p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Feducation%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-student-led-backlash-against-new-orleanss-charter-schools%2F283597%2F&amp;t=The+Student-Led+Backlash+Against+New+Orleans%27s+Charter+Schools" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/sc/8/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530260433/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f05/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/D-nWYYkYass" width="1" />

V<span>Washington, D.C.; February 5, 2014</span><p> \u2013 M. Scott Havens, President of <em><span>The Atlantic</span></em> announced today that <span>Anna Bross</span> has been named Senior Director of Communications for the brand.  In this role, Bross will oversee all media and public relations for <em><span>The Atlantic</span></em>, which include the magazine, its three websites - TheAtlantic.com, The Wire, and The Atlantic Cities - and the brand\u2019s live events division, AtlanticLIVE.  Bross, who is currently Director of Media Relations for NPR, will be based in <em><span>The Atlantic</span></em>\u2019s Washington, DC headquarters and will report to Emily Lenzner, Atlantic Media Vice President of Global Communications.  Her first day is February 20.</p><p> \u201cI am delighted to welcome Anna to our growing <em><span>Atlantic</span> </em>family.  Anna not only brings a deep expertise in communications strategy, but also a clear understanding of news across all media platforms, and a true spirit of collaboration,\u201d said Havens. \u201cAs a key player in NPR\u2019s growth over the last seven years, Anna is well positioned to join <em><span>The Atlantic</span></em> team as we continue to expand in new and exciting ways.\u201d</p><p> Added Lenzner, \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone more perfect to lead communications for The Atlantic. I\u2019m thrilled to have Anna join the team.\u201d  </p><p> In her seven years with NPR, Bross rose quickly, becoming the lead director of all media relations for the network, its programs and digital and music properties.  During this period, she led the roll-out strategy and execution for the launches of NPR Music and its apps, as well as the responsive redesign of NPR\u2019s website in 2013. Prior to joining NPR, she was a senior publicist at WHYY in Philadelphia.  </p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpersonal%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fanna-bross-named-senior-director-of-communications-for-i-the-atlantic-i%2F283612%2F&amp;t=Anna+Bross+Named+Senior+Director+of+Communications+for+%3Ci%3EThe+Atlantic%3C%2Fi%3E" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpersonal%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fanna-bross-named-senior-director-of-communications-for-i-the-atlantic-i%2F283612%2F&amp;t=Anna+Bross+Named+Senior+Director+of+Communications+for+%3Ci%3EThe+Atlantic%3C%2Fi%3E" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpersonal%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fanna-bross-named-senior-director-of-communications-for-i-the-atlantic-i%2F283612%2F&amp;t=Anna+Bross+Named+Senior+Director+of+Communications+for+%3Ci%3EThe+Atlantic%3C%2Fi%3E" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpersonal%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fanna-bross-named-senior-director-of-communications-for-i-the-atlantic-i%2F283612%2F&amp;t=Anna+Bross+Named+Senior+Director+of+Communications+for+%3Ci%3EThe+Atlantic%3C%2Fi%3E" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpersonal%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fanna-bross-named-senior-director-of-communications-for-i-the-atlantic-i%2F283612%2F&amp;t=Anna+Bross+Named+Senior+Director+of+Communications+for+%3Ci%3EThe+Atlantic%3C%2Fi%3E" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530260431/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf6f0c/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/2BsJfiXzMkU" width="1" />

At first, there are mere hints that the agency is spying in some way that would be controversial. Gradually, the public gets circumstantial evidence. The truth becomes obvious to the small percentage of Americans who are paying close attention, but there's no way to prove it.</p> <p>Finally, the proof arrives! But even though the mere prospect used to be alarming, confirmation is now treated as no big deal: "Oh, everybody knew that already." </p> <p>We're having one of those moments.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>-----News flash-----</strong> </p> <p><strong>The NSA collects and stores information on phone calls made by members of Congress!</strong> Doing so gives the executive branch control of information that could be used to discredit multiple legislators on the theory that it will never be abused. This is imprudent. If I could have reported it as fact five years ago, it would've been a huge story. Now, the revelation is treated as no big deal.</p> <p>"Because c'mon, haven't we known for awhile?"</p> <p>Last month, when Senator Bernie Sanders <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/bernie-sanders-national-security-agency-spying-101726.html#ixzz2pVgAp3Wu">asked</a> the NSA if it spies on Congress, he couldn't get a direct answer. I <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/the-danger-of-nsa-spying-on-members-of-congress/282827/">noted</a> then that the NSA <em>does</em> spy on congressional phone calls\u2014that's what inevitably happens when you spy on virtually every phone call\u2014but that acknowledging as much would unnerve Americans. </p> <p>On Tuesday, during a House Judiciary Committee hearing,<span> we got a lot closer to proof, thanks to Deputy Attorney General James Cole. As <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/technology/feds-nsa-probably-spies-on-members-of-congress-20140204">reported</a> in <em>National Journal</em>:</span></p> <blockquote> <p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, began by asking Peter Swire, a member of the president's handpicked surveillance review board, whether lawmakers' numbers are included in the agency's phone-records sweeps. Swire protested that he was not a government official and couldn't best answer the question, but said he was unaware of any mechanism that "scrubbed out" member phone numbers from the agency's data haul.</p> <p>Lofgren's time expired and Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, then put the question to Cole. "Mr. Cole, do you collect 202, 225, and four digits afterwards?" Issa asked, referring to the prefixes used to call congressional offices. "We probably do, Mr. Congressman," Cole responded. "But we're not allowed to look at any of those, however, unless we have reasonable, articulable suspicion that those numbers are related to a known terrorist threat."</p> </blockquote> <p>These are alarming answers for several reasons.</p> <p>1) Most importantly, this is an obvious threat to our democracy and the separation of powers upon which it relies. It gives the executive branch, under this president and all future presidents, a powerful, illegitimate means to undermine legislative opponents. In fact, legislators could be targeted in a way that would be both devastating and easy to pull off <em>without even the victim knowing what happened</em>. There's no need to blackmail. Just dig up some dirt on a legislator, or his spouse, or her business partner, using metadata; figure out how an opposition researcher might happen upon the same information; and leak it to the press as if you are one. The executive branch is already becoming expert at parallel construction. It's perhaps easier than breaking into the Watergate.</p> <p>NSA defenders insist that the professionals at that agency would never stand for such abuses, that they are just there to protect the safety of Americans. If that retort is offered in earnest, it only proves that those using it don't understand the precautions that must be taken in order to insure against abuses by fallible humans. The U.S. soldiers who perpetrated the horrors at Abu Ghraib mostly enlisted to protect their country. The FBI agents who tried to blackmail Martin Luther King mostly signed up for their jobs to protect their country. The folks who carried out the Watergate break-in mostly joined the Nixon Administration with at least some altruistic motives. But power often corrupts judgment and character. </p> <p>That aspect of human nature will never change. Abuse attempts will happen in the future, including at the NSA. The damage done will depend in part on how much power is concentrated there. The dragnet concentrates lots of power over legislators and other Americans in a secretive agency with a history of repeated legal abuses; an agency staffed with employees who carried out illegal, warrantless wiretapping under the last president; an agency that could easily poke around in the metadata without its overseers knowing if it wanted to abuse its power again. </p> <p>2) If we take Peter Swire and James Cole at their words, both of them believe that Congress is included in the dragnet, but neither of them are 100 percent sure.</p> <p>Seriously?</p> <p>They could be misrepresenting what they know to Congress, which would be troubling. The alternative is troubling too. One of these guys was a member of a presidential task force charged with studying NSA surveillance. The other is the deputy AG. And neither knows <em>for sure</em> if the NSA is spying on Congress? Really? That hugely fraught detail isn't one they felt a need to be 100 percent clear on? It's just a question that came up in a hearing and now they can make a guess?</p> <p>3) Cole says the NSA can't look at calls to and from congressional offices "<span>unless we have reasonable, articulable suspicion that those numbers are related to a known terrorist threat." But as I understand it, the protection that he's invoking is effectively meaningless, especially for official congressional phone lines.</span></p> <p><span>Here's what I mean: </span>The NSA permits itself to query a selector only when there is a reasonable, articulable suspicion that it's related to a terrorist threat ... but then the NSA can pull in metadata for numbers within three hops of that selector ... and then it can store <em>all of that</em> in what's dubbed "the corporate store." Considering how many people call congressional offices, and how many people congressional offices call, it stands to reason that if the NSA wanted congressional metadata in the corporate store, it could have it there. Perhaps it "minimizes" most congressional communications. After all, at this instant, there's no reason to believe anything nefarious is going on, and it would make practical sense to strip those contacts out of search results to better focus on normal networks of communications.</p> <p><span>But even in that best-case scenario, the dragnet, the tool of potential abuse, remains in place, and minimization procedures could always be quietly changed. As well, I wonder whether the <a href="http://www.emptywheel.net/2014/02/03/for-the-purposes-of-analytical-efficiency-making-copies-of-the-dragnet/">copies of the phone dragnet</a> are made pre-minimization? </span></p> <p>Congress ought to jealously guard its power, as the Framers intended, by ending the dragnet that gives a co-equal branch information about their phone communications. And their constituents ought to demand this of them. For more on this subject, and to learn about the fraught political implications of the time the NSA spied on a phone call involving former Rep.

The Federal Reserve is continuing its policy of trimming its bond purchases by $10 billion a month, and the immediate result has been a sharp pullback of the currencies, and to some degree equities, of countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, India, South Africa and Argentina. The reason? According to traders, commentators, and even the head of Brazil\u2019s central bank, Fed policy will trigger interest rate rises around the world, staunching the flow of easy money that has purportedly fueled global growth \u2014 and leading to struggles everywhere.</p> <p>That thesis is hardly new. It was widely circulated last summer, when the Fed first hinted that it might begin to wind down its more aggressive measures to stimulate economic activity, which it introduced after 2009. In this reading, the boom times of many countries around the world has had nothing to do with the change in economic fortunes, or skilled leadership, or shifting global sands. It was and is simply a derivative of U.S. policies.</p> <p>This view has wide play, and goes nearly unchallenged. That does not make it correct.</p> <p>Indeed, it is likely wrong for at least two major reasons: it forgets that financial markets are not perfect proxies for real world economies, and it misses the fundamental transformation in countries around the world that has taken place over the past few decades and is about to accelerate this year.</p> <!-- PULL QUOTE v. 2 --> <!-- END PULL QUOTE v. 2 --><p>As I wrote in a <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/edgy-optimist/2013/08/23/our-imperial-disdain-for-the-emerging-world/">column</a> last August, a U.S.-centric view extends well back into the 20th century, and the only wrinkle today is that China has now entered the mix. Low and behold, China, too, has recently seen some slowing of its growth, largely because of the determination of the Chinese government to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/30/markets-europe-stocks-idUSL5N0L42OB20140130">shift the mix</a> of its economic growth from state-led infrastructure and exports to domestic consumption. That transition will, inevitably, result in diminishing demand for commodities and raw materials, and that demand had also been a key factor in the strength of other economies, including many of the ones above.</p> <p>Yes, China\u2019s voracious demand for raw materials did provide a boost to countries as far-ranging as Chile, South Africa, Indonesia and Brazil. And yes, easy money from the Federal Reserve did get deployed to more speculative currencies ranging from Turkey to Argentina. But that speaks only to the narrow \u2014 albeit attention-grabbing and important \u2014 financial markets. Financial markets are roiling, as they do from time to time, but that doesn\u2019t result in less activity by companies such as Unilever or Starbucks, nor a halt in the emergence of a global middle class in numerous countries.</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t overweight the significance of financial markets when evaluating the status of emerging markets; to do so is to espouse a particularly U.S.-centric view of how the world works. More voters, and more Starbucks lattes, are bellwethers for progress, irrespective of how markets are performing.</p> <p>Even more, what financial markets miss, in addition to the factors above, is that this year will see a massive democratic surge around the world. In fact, in a span of several months more people than ever before will go to the polls. In part, that is a natural consequence of more people living on the planet than any other time in history, but between now and this fall, massive democracies will elect parliaments, congresses and presidents.</p> <p>Many of those countries, in fact, are the ones currently experiencing financial market volatility. Turkey, which has seen a run on the lira and then aggressive action by the Turkish central bank to raise interest rates, will have an election in August to determine the fate of the embattled prime minister, Recip Erdogan, and his Islamist party. Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim democracy with more than 250 million people, will chose a new president and parliament over the summer. In October, more than a hundred million Brazilian voters will decide whether Dilma Roussef has earned another term in the midst of questionable economic growth and after hosting the World Cup. And in <a href="http://www.ndi.org/electionscalendar">May</a>, India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest democracy \u2014 will elect a new government and see whether it can at last break the political knot that has constrained its economic potential.</p> <p>The sheer volume of this democratic activity is unusual, and combined with the inevitably partisan midterm elections in the United States in November, it is a recipe for some volatility. Democracy, as we all know, is messy, noisy, chaotic, often bitter and frequently inconclusive. It is a perfect recipe for the kind of uncertainty that financial market participants frequently say they dislike. As such, it also provides the perfect excuse for sharp swings in sentiment and short-term-ism as traders attempt to game outcomes and as longer-term investors sit on the side awaiting the verdict of the polls.</p> <p>Yet, if you had asked Americans or Europeans in the middle of the 20th century and indeed the parents of the hundreds of millions who will vote this year to define their ambitions for the early 21st century, their dreams would have been the world as it is today: one of democratic inclusiveness, increasingly open markets, rising affluence, and more and more freedom of movement, of economic life and of personal life than ever before, all capped by imperfect but radically improved political systems.</p> <p>The coming months will see no end of obituaries written for the emerging world, and of the perils they face. There is nothing new about these prognostications, and they all miss the glaring realities of democratic transformation and its sometimes tumultuous consequences. They miss as well the degree to which hundreds of millions have seen vastly increased <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/hdi">living standards</a>, and are willing to demand some degree of accountability from their governments. That is a recipe for global security, and long-term prosperity, even if far too many declare the opposite.</p> <hr /><p><small><i>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/edgy-optimist/2014/02/04/in-emerging-countries-focus-on-progress-not-market-volatility">Reuters.com</a>, an </i>Atlantic <i>partner site.</i></small></p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-state-of-emerging-markets-up-down-and-up-but-still-moving-forward%2F283611%2F&amp;t=The+State+of+Emerging+Markets%3A+Up%2C+Down%2C+and+Up%E2%80%94But+Still+Moving+Forward" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-state-of-emerging-markets-up-down-and-up-but-still-moving-forward%2F283611%2F&amp;t=The+State+of+Emerging+Markets%3A+Up%2C+Down%2C+and+Up%E2%80%94But+Still+Moving+Forward" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-state-of-emerging-markets-up-down-and-up-but-still-moving-forward%2F283611%2F&amp;t=The+State+of+Emerging+Markets%3A+Up%2C+Down%2C+and+Up%E2%80%94But+Still+Moving+Forward" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-state-of-emerging-markets-up-down-and-up-but-still-moving-forward%2F283611%2F&amp;t=The+State+of+Emerging+Markets%3A+Up%2C+Down%2C+and+Up%E2%80%94But+Still+Moving+Forward" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-state-of-emerging-markets-up-down-and-up-but-still-moving-forward%2F283611%2F&amp;t=The+State+of+Emerging+Markets%3A+Up%2C+Down%2C+and+Up%E2%80%94But+Still+Moving+Forward" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530258670/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bf4b81/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Geof66ZH9d0" width="1" />

Here\u2019s a predictive guide to the biggest stories of the Olympics\u2014as well as some quietly compelling alternative storylines, the best days to tune in, and the words and phrases you should know before plunging into the sprawling media coverage of the Games.</p> <hr /><p><big><small><strong>People you\u2019re about to get sick of hearing about: </strong></small></big>There\u2019s no escaping the United States\u2019 <strong>Shaun White.</strong> Perhaps the most recognizable and dominant winter-sport athlete of his generation, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/17/shaun-white-tony-hawk-business-sports_0218_action_sports.html">ubiquitous product spokesman</a> and two-time gold medalist in snowboard halfpipe is back to defend his title in his third Olympic Games\u2014and, as these things tend to happen, he now finds himself one of the older competitors in the field. Among his many hungry young challengers is the 15-year-old Japanese wunderkind Ayumu Hirano, who, last when he was 14, took second place to White at the 2013 Winter X Games. <em>Sports Illustrated</em> <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1209391/index.htm">calls Hirano</a> \u201cthe biggest threat to Shaun White's Olympic dominance.\u201d White had plans to compete in the inaugural Olympic snowboard slopestyle event (more on that later), but announced on Wednesday morning that he was dropping out of the competition.*</p> <p>But, speaking of athletes with a seemingly omniscient advertising presence, there\u2019s also <strong>Ted Ligety</strong>\u2014the 28-year-old American alpine skier and part-time <a href="http://youtu.be/ibCJdIJCBJM">muse for hilarious musical JC Penney ads</a>\u2014who arrives in Sochi after the best season of his career. The 18-time World Cup winner earned three gold medals at the 2013 World Championships in Austria, and looks to add a few more Olympic medals to the gold he won in the combined event in 2006.</p> <p>And in the absence of the injured fan favorite Lindsey Vonn, much of the focus in this year\u2019s women\u2019s events will shift to <strong>Mikaela Shiffrin</strong>, the 18-year-old Colorado native who graced one of the covers of <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/gracie-gold--mikaela-shiffrin-get-sports-illustrated-cover-love-for-olympics-issue-214114340.html"><em>Sports Illustrated</em>\u2019s Olympics preview issue</a>. Shiffrin, who specializes in slalom and giant slalom, holds a World Cup title and a world championship title in slalom.</p> <p><strong>Subplots worth noting: </strong>An ocean away from Ligety, Shifrin, and White, another intriguing story has been quietly brewing in Norway. Thirty-three-year-old cross-country skier <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/140109/bjoergen-remains-benchmark-cross-country"><strong>Marit Bjoergen</strong></a>, a fourth-time Winter Olympian with seven medals to her name, will attempt to add more to her collection. Bjoergen said in January she was considering competing in six events in Sochi; if she gets to 11 medals, she\u2019ll <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/sports/2014/01/27/winter-olympic-trivia-sochi-2014/4952845/">become</a> the most decorated female winter Olympian ever.</p> <p>Her personal goal, however, is modest: one individual gold. \u201cI know how hard it is," she told Reuters in January. "You have to have a good day.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps the most compelling storyline this year will center on the success or failure of a newly minted Olympic competition: the visually splendid <strong>men\u2019s and women\u2019s slopestyle events.</strong> The skiing and snowboarding forms of slopestyle\u2014which will both appear at the Olympics this year\u2014combine terrain and aerial elements. A winter X Games staple, the slopestyle events are just two of several new competitions added to the Olympic program this year\u2014alongside men\u2019s and women\u2019s ski halfpipe, men\u2019s and women\u2019s snowboard parallel special slalom, and women\u2019s ski jumping.</p> <p>A quick intro, by way of Shaun White\u2019s gold medal-winning snowboard slopestyle run at the 2012 X Games:</p>  <p>At this point, however, concerns about the events\u2019 safety have clouded the excitement. Norway\u2019s Torstein Horgmo, considered a medal contender in snowboard slopestyle, <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2014/snowboarding/story/_/id/10395371/snowboarder-torstein-horgmo-hospital-accident-practice">pulled out of competition</a> after breaking his collarbone during a training run on Monday. On Tuesday, White <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/winter-olympics-2014-shaun-white-injured-on-intimidating-olympics-course/">wiped out</a> and jammed his wrist; later that day, Finland's Marika Enne left the course on a stretcher after falling and getting a concussion. Olympic officials are reportedly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/sports/olympics/snowboard-course-will-change-after-athletes-complain-of-danger.html?hpw&amp;rref=sports">revamping the course</a>\u2014which White calls "intimidating"\u2014to avoid safety hazards.</p> <p><b>Words and phrases to know:</b></p> <p><em>The 1440 Triple Cork</em>:<i> </i>The arrival of slopestyle brings with it all sorts of new eye-popping (and dangerous) spectacles\u2014and one of them is the complicated snowboarding maneuver involving four complete rotations and three separate instances in which the athlete is upside down. The documentary <em>Shaun White: Russia Calling</em> <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/01/22/shaun-white-sochi-olympics/">chronicled</a> the snowboarding champ\u2019s struggle to master the trick before the Olympics. At the time, it was a necessary measure* aimed at maintaining a competitive edge: As Transworld Snowboarding <a href="http://snowboarding.transworld.net/1000219991/photos/sochi-2014-mens-olympic-slopestyle-outlook/">puts it</a>, \u201cWhen slopestyle makes its Olympic debut \u2026 Sochi will be the triple-cork Games.\u201d</p>  <p><em>Progression</em>:<strong> </strong>In addition to the precision of their execution, the amplitude of their jumps, and the difficulty, variety, and amplitude of their maneuvers, slopestyle and halfpipe snowboarders are also judged in the unusual category of \u201cprogression\u201d\u2014that is, the extent to which they\u2019ve added new tweaks or twists to existing tricks.</p> <p><strong>Best days to watch: </strong>Tune in on February 8 and 9 for the women\u2019s and men\u2019s slopestyle competitions, respectively. And on February 11, come back for the widest variety of ski and snowboard events the fortnight offers: men\u2019s and women\u2019s cross-country sprint events, women\u2019s ski slopestyle, men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe, and women\u2019s ski jumping. </p> <p>*<strong>Update (</strong><strong>9:50 a.m.):</strong> This post has been updated to reflect that Shaun White <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/sports/olympics/shaun-white-drops-out-of-new-snowboard-event.html?_r=1">has dropped out</a> of the snowboard slopestyle event. </p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsochi-2014-does-shaun-white-still-have-an-edge-over-his-challengers%2F283593%2F&amp;t=Sochi+2014%3A+Does+Shaun+White+Still+Have+an+Edge+Over+His+Challengers%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsochi-2014-does-shaun-white-still-have-an-edge-over-his-challengers%2F283593%2F&amp;t=Sochi+2014%3A+Does+Shaun+White+Still+Have+an+Edge+Over+His+Challengers%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsochi-2014-does-shaun-white-still-have-an-edge-over-his-challengers%2F283593%2F&amp;t=Sochi+2014%3A+Does+Shaun+White+Still+Have+an+Edge+Over+His+Challengers%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsochi-2014-does-shaun-white-still-have-an-edge-over-his-challengers%2F283593%2F&amp;t=Sochi+2014%3A+Does+Shaun+White+Still+Have+an+Edge+Over+His+Challengers%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fsochi-2014-does-shaun-white-still-have-an-edge-over-his-challengers%2F283593%2F&amp;t=Sochi+2014%3A+Does+Shaun+White+Still+Have+an+Edge+Over+His+Challengers%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/187557432128/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bedb8e/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/DnOyadpGzTI" width="1" />

VA third of patients who go to the hospital for bipolar I disorder are on four (or more) psychiatric medications\u2014despite a lack of evidence that's a good idea. This highlights the complexity of the disease and the need for more science.<img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/a2t.img" width="1" />

All of this happened without clinical research to show that combining three or more medications was effective.</p> <p>When medications are added to other medications, it can be hard to know which effects are due to which medication. If we replace one of the medications, will all the cards fall? Is this completely safe in the long term? We do know that the practice, known within the medical community as polypharmacy and sometimes defended in literature as a "<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f7033">necessary evil</a>," costs money and increases potential for drug interactions and side effects. As Weinstock <a href="http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2014/02/polypharmacy">said</a> in the university's press release, "By definition that\u2019s not evidence-based treatment."</p> <p>Evidence-based treatment is the buzzword movement aimed at getting doctors to only do things that are supported by sound research.</p> <p>Medication for bipolar disorder can work, can be wonderful. If studies find prescribing four or five or seven medications is sometimes prudent and necessary, then that will be that. It's not ideal to ask anyone to remember to take that many pills, especially in cases of mental health that may involve flights of mania wherein a person feels invincible and is buying yachts on credit, alternating with periods of major depression wherein getting to a pharmacy to fill and orchestrate a half dozen prescriptions can be an insurmountable proposition. Not to mention the psychology of it. Look how many pills you require. But at least as patients and doctors we'd have the reassurance that it's proven to work.</p> <p>Given the scale and nature of the disorder, that kind of science should be a priority. \u201cWithout many treatment alternatives," Weinstock said, "this is where we are as a field.\u201d</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fshooting-pills-at-bipolar-disorder%2F283591%2F&amp;t=Shooting+Pills+at+Bipolar+Disorder" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530197969/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bdea1d/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/WCsG7Yf6ceI" width="1" />

Or so I gather from a nicely done<b> </b><em>New York</em> <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/ezra-klein-2014-2/">profile</a> by Benjamin Wallace:</p> <blockquote> <p>During his eight years working in Washington, [Klein] had become convinced of a structural flaw in the way journalism is practiced\u2014and he believed he might know how to do it better and very profitably. \u201cWe think there are a lot of ways in which the technology underlying journalism is reinforcing habits developed, and workflows developed, back when we were tied to killing trees and printing them out and having children deliver them to people,\u201d he said. He then set forth a more general analysis of journalism. The column inches devoted to the new are column inches not given to the important, and this stress on novelty is a holdover from when the cost of making and moving paper limited what you could print. \u201cThe web explodes that constraint,\u201d Klein said. "[Yet] we haven\u2019t created a resource that people can really use. We\u2019ve just created a resource where it\u2019s really easy to come and find out what happened today.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>What will his alternative look like? A "21st Century encyclopedia" as much as a news site. <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">"We want to think really hard about how to connect not just new information, but to bring it together with important contextual information to create a more thorough source and place to understand the world," Klein said. Project X isn't ready to reveal </span><em style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">how</em><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;"> it intends to better integrate context into the subjects that it intends to cover. But the team it has assembled and the buy-in from Vox Media suggests it has ideas. That excites me: I've been thinking about some of the problems that Klein identifies for a long time, and I don't quite know what to expect besides solutions I've never thought of before, which are the most fun to anticipate.  </span></p> <p>Here's what I'll be wondering as Project X launches:</p> <p><strong>What role, if any, will narrative storytelling play? </strong></p> <p>Klein's success is owed largely to his ability to explain complicated subjects to a large audience of readers who come away feeling informed, not confused. He focuses on policy, and doesn't typically do it through narrative storytelling, though he's a versatile writer. You're more likely to find a chart on Wonkblog than a character. <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">What role, if any, will narrative storytelling play in his news organization?</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">I wonder because character-driven narratives are a powerful tool for explaining complicated subjects in a way that starts at the beginning and provides massive context. </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Good stories are also something to offer when you're not competing on new.</span></p> <p>The best piece of explanatory journalism ever produced, in the estimation of press critic Jay Rosen, is the <em>This American Life</em> episode, "<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money">The Giant Pool of Money</a>." It was, basically, an hour-long explainer of the subprime-mortgage crisis. "Going in to the program, I didn\u2019t understand the mortgage mess one bit: <em>subprime loans were ruining Wall Street firms? And I care because they are old, respected firms? </em>That\u2019s what I knew," <a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2008/08/13/national_explain.html">Rosen wrote</a>. "Coming out of the program, I understood the complete scam: what happened, why it happened, and why I should care. I had a good sense of the motivations and situations of players all down the line. Civic mastery was mine over a complex story, dense with technical terms, unfolding on many fronts..." </p> <p>He wasn't alone. It was the most successful hour in the history of a wildly successful show. NPR launched a new show, <em>Planet Money</em>, in response to its success. Of course, the <em>This American Life</em> approach is extremely resource intensive and difficult to execute. It requires weeks of reporting, willing sources, and a talent for narrative storytelling\u2013and on a given subject, you're competing with everyone to produce <em>the</em> go-to piece. Sometimes, Michael Lewis is just going to write the best explanatory story about a particular financial event, and then what?</p> <p>But consistent storytelling success quickly engenders unparalleled loyalty in your audience, which trusts you to make complicated subjects comprehensible in the most enjoyable way. Since this is a very old way to explain complicated subjects with context, not a new way, I presume it isn't the main approach Project X will use. But whatever else they do, when and how will narrative storytelling be deployed?</p> <p><strong>In what order should news be consumed?</strong></p> <p>Here's Jay Rosen once more (my emphasis):</p> <blockquote> <p>I noticed something in the weeks after I first listened to \u201cThe Giant Pool of Money.\u201d I became a customer for ongoing news about the mortgage mess and the credit crisis that developed from it... \u2018Twas a successful act of explanation that put me in the market for information. Before that moment I had ignored hundreds of news reports...</p> <p>In the normal hierarchy of journalistic achievement the most \u201cbasic\u201d acts are reporting today\u2019s news and providing current information, as with prices, weather reports and ball scores. We think of \u201canalysis,\u201d \u201cinterpretation,\u201d and also \u201cexplanation\u201d as higher order acts. They come after the news has been reported...</p> <p>In this model, I would receive news about something brewing in the mortgage banking arena and note it. (\u201c\u201dSubprime lenders in trouble: check.\u201d) <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Then I would receive some more news and perhaps keep an even closer eye on the story. After absorbing additional reports of ongoing problems in the mortgage market I might then turn to an \u201canalysis\u201d piece for more on the possible consequences... I thus graduate from the simpler to the more sophisticated forms of news as I learn more about a potentially far-reaching development. </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">That\u2019s the way it works\u2026 right?</span></p> <p>Wrong!</p> <p>There are some stories where until I grasp the <em>whole </em> I am unable to make sense of <em>any</em> part. Not only am I not a customer for news reports prior to that moment, <strong>but the very frequency of the updates alienates me from the providers of those updates because the news stream is adding daily to my feeling of being ill-informed, overwhelmed, out of the loop</strong>. I respond with indifference, even though I\u2019ve picked up a blinking red light from the news system\u2019s repeated placement of \u201csubprime\u201d items in front of me.</p> </blockquote> <p>I suspect a lot of Americans are feeling this way about the NSA surveillance story right now: overwhelmed, out of the loop, under-informed, not quite sure how to catch up, and disinclined to follow the daily stream of newspaper reporting as a result. Would Project X aim to start with a full explainer? Or explain each news cycle's stories in context as they trickle out? Will it vary depending on the story? If so, will Project X be better at one mode or the other? What will it train its readers to expect?</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Rosen went on to run an experiment at NYU where he and his students tried to build a better explainer, in partnership with ProPublica. One effort touched another complicated story, fracking. Here's a short, catchy video they produced on the subject:</span></p>  <p>Now, note how one of Rosen's students <a href="http://explainer.net/thefrackingsong/">characterizes</a> this video\u2013his notion of how it fits in the journalistic landscape (my emphasis):</p> <blockquote> <p>The best explainers are direct, concise and easy to understand. But investigative journalism is rarely any of those things, instead reflecting the messiness of real life.</p> <p>That\u2019s why <strong>explanation is just the beginning, a gateway into the kind of deep-dives for which ProPublica is known and respected</strong>. <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">\u201cMy Water\u2019s On Fire Tonight (The Fracking Song)\u201d is not meant to take the place of the </span><a href="http://www.propublica.org/series/buried-secrets-gas-drillings-environmental-threat" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">rich, detailed investigation</a><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;"> done by Abrahm Lustgarten and the rest of ProPublica\u2019s frack squad. It\u2019s impossible to sum up a massive, immersive experience like \u201cBuried Secrets\u201d in a two-and-a-half minute song. Instead, the intent is to bring people in, to create an easily digestible package that compels news consumers to dig into the real meat of the story. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">An explainer is not \u201ceverything you need to know about X.\u201d It\u2019s not a shortcut to becoming an armchair expert. But it is the starting point, the big picture, the tiny bundle of information that gives users the context to appreciate and understand the most challenging and rewarding works of journalism.</span></strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Will Project X try to provide the starting point, the "big picture," <em>and</em> the most challenging and rewarding works of journalism? Or will it specialize in a particular stage of news consumption? If some of its readers are coming to fracking as newbies, and others as University of Nebraska geologists, how will it satisfy both kinds of customers, if not by emphasizing "newness" or character-driven narrative storytelling? It sounds like Project X will try to structure the site in a way that allows people to begin accessing its coverage at several different levels of complexity.</p> <p>How?</p> <p><strong>Will Project X ever sell proprietary software?</strong></p><p> It wouldn't be the first journalistic startup to try. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/a-news-organization-that-rejects-the-view-from-nowhere/281979/">Pierre Omidyar's new venture</a> is reportedly going to include a non-profit arm that produces journalism while being subsidized by a proprietary software arm. <em>The Atavist</em>, which sells narrative nonfiction as e-book singles, licenses software that helps others to create "long form" templates. </p><p>If Project X develops software that helps news organizations retain important context while reporting what's new, the biggest beneficiaries may turn out to be purveyors and consumers of local journalism. That's where rounds of layoffs, low pay, and low prestige have caused the most dramatic staff turnover and loss of institutional knowledge. Twenty-four-year-old reporters are assigned to municipal beats about which they know nothing, and there's no longer an old hand at the city desk to interject when an article would benefit from facts already in the record. Assuming retention rates don't increase dramatically in community journalism, a software platform that resembles building out a wiki as much as publishing a WordPress entry might improve the product over time by helping to rebuild institutional knowledge. </p> <p>Of course, t<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">here are plenty of youngsters writing about national politics too, but historical information is more readily available, and youngsters coexist with older, more experienced hands, who helpfully inject context into the national conversation (e.g., in 2016, a new president will give a victory speech. And you'll be able to read the analysis of former White House speechwriters James Fallows, David Frum, Hendrik Hertzberg, Peter Robinson, Peggy Noonan, Troy Senik and others besides). </span></p> <p><strong>Is there ever a downside to context?</strong></p> <p>I can think of one.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">In </span><em style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">The Press Effect</em><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Paul Waldman argue that reporting on presidential campaigns is distorted by reporters' tendency to see all new events through the lens of established narratives. During Election 200o, Al Gore was tagged as a liar and George W. Bush as an idiot. Any grain of truth in those stereotypes was exaggerated due to confirmation bias. I raise this example because the problem wasn't journalism that focused on the present at the expense of the important. Rather, the attempt to filter the present through what was perceived to be important went astray, because journalists had simplistic, wrongheaded notions of what was important. The reporting was undermined by flawed context.</span></p> <p>An institutional commitment (perhaps even built into a site's infrastructure?) to cover what's new <em>in the context of what's important</em> forces a news organization to make judgment calls about what's important. That's often good and necessary, but it can go wrong, especially when the news organization is unsure about how to contextualize a story. A small bomb blows up in Times Square. Police arrest a suspect who was born in Pakistan. What's the context? But wait a minute. It subsequently turns out that he was born there to white, American parents who moved him at age 3 to Long Beach, California, where he later joined a gang with white supremacist leanings. Now what's the context? I<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">f your template locks you into always having to situate a story in its proper context right away you can see how that would be problematic. And a "breaking news, terrorist attack" example is hardly the only time when this would matter. Think about the way the press covered the Iraq War. A lot of people changed their mind about what the "right" context was, and had the press stayed agnostic all along news coverage might've been better. At the very least, the "right" context is often a highly contestable matter.</span></p> <p><strong>Will Project X attempt the View from Nowhere?</strong></p> <p>There are several identity questions Project X must grapple with:</p> <ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">How important is ideological diversity to management?</span></li> <li>Will employees be creating journalism as individuals with particular viewpoints, in the fashion that Matt Yglesias, to name one of them, has always done? Will Project X attempt an organizational voice with a viewpoint, like <em>The Economist</em>? Will it attempt a metro-newspaper-style "View from Nowhere"?</li> <li>How ideologically diverse is the readership that Project X hopes to attract? Is Klein's existing audience "the base"? Insofar as a bigger audience is hoped for will it come from expanding ideologically, or to folks interested in subjects besides policy, or to a less elite audience?</li> <li>What will be the mix among analysis, commentary, and original reporting? And how about the mix among writing, graphics, video, and audio?</li> <li>How important is gender and racial diversity to management? </li> <li>As much as any blogger, Klein has experienced writing about politics as an outsider and an insider. Where is Project X going to position itself on that spectrum?</li> <li>Does it matter to Project X whether a Republican or Democrat wins in 2016, from an editorial or business perspective?</li> </ul><p>As you can see, there's a lot about Project X we don't know\u2014so much, in fact, that I've probably raised some questions that the startup's team doesn't even need to answer, because I've assumed something about their concept that just isn't going to be so. That's okay, because the rest of journalism should also be thinking harder about how best to harness the web and better contextualize the subjects that we all cover. I'm rooting for Team Klein to implement something novel, useful, and lasting. </p> <p>And whatever happens, I'm curious to see it.</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-will-ezra-kleins-project-x-add-context-to-news%2F283568%2F&amp;t=How+Will+Ezra+Klein%27s+%27Project+X%27+Add+Context+to+News%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-will-ezra-kleins-project-x-add-context-to-news%2F283568%2F&amp;t=How+Will+Ezra+Klein%27s+%27Project+X%27+Add+Context+to+News%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-will-ezra-kleins-project-x-add-context-to-news%2F283568%2F&amp;t=How+Will+Ezra+Klein%27s+%27Project+X%27+Add+Context+to+News%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-will-ezra-kleins-project-x-add-context-to-news%2F283568%2F&amp;t=How+Will+Ezra+Klein%27s+%27Project+X%27+Add+Context+to+News%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-will-ezra-kleins-project-x-add-context-to-news%2F283568%2F&amp;t=How+Will+Ezra+Klein%27s+%27Project+X%27+Add+Context+to+News%3F" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530251185/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bd62e4/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/7m7Y-j1U4SU" width="1" />

The essence of the story, deeply reported first by the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, is that the industry is based upon the incentive to charge as many people as much as possible to allow them to avoid jail. The result, predictably, is that the people least able to pay their fines are the ones preyed upon the most.</p> <p>Today, the folks at Human Rights Watch issue a trenchant report, titled "<a href="http://www.hrw.org/embargo/node/122851?signature=3b1fbfc2a6d3109dc6f019761766a8e1&amp;suid=6">Profiting from Probation: America's 'Offender-Funded Probation Industry</a>," that details just how pervasive this problem is. It's not just that these companies are engaged in predatory behavior, the report tells us, it's that public officials have abdicated their obligations to their constituents to protect them from the worst of these practices. Here's one key passage from this must-read work:</p> <blockquote> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This report, based largely on more than 75 interviews conducted with people in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi during the second half of 2013, describes patterns of abuse and financial hardship inflicted by the \u201coffender-funded\u201d model of privatized probation that prevails in well over 1,000 courts across the US. It shows how some company probation officers behave like abusive debt collectors. It explains how some courts and probation companies combine to jail offenders who fall behind on payments they cannot afford to make, in spite of clear legal protections meant to prohibit this.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It also argues that the fee structure of offender-funded probation is inherently discriminatory against poor offenders, and imposes the greatest financial burden on those who are least able to afford to pay. In fact, the business of many private probation companies is built largely on the willingness of courts to discriminate against poor offenders who can only afford to pay their fines in installments over time.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The problems described in this report are not a consequence of probation privatization <em>per se</em>. Rather, they arise because public officials allow probation companies to profit by extracting fees directly from probationers, and then fail to exercise the kind of oversight needed to protect probationers from abusive and extortionate practices. All too often, offenders on private probation are threatened with jail for failing to pay probation fees they simply cannot afford, and some spend time behind bars. This report tells many of their stories.</p> </blockquote> <p>The perils of private probation isn't a bigger national story, I reckon, because it does not impact the rich and powerful nearly as much as it impacts the poor and powerless. The constituency most impacted by this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/littledorrit/biography/">retro</a> approach is the least capable of exercising the political power required to change it. In this sense, the story is remarkably similar to the story of the nation's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/03/how-americans-lost-the-right-to-counsel-50-years-after-gideon/273433/">shameful and lingering failure to provide indigent defendants with the right to counsel</a> guaranteed to them in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/335"><em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em></a>. Here is more from the HRW report:</p> <blockquote> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Traditionally, courts use probation to offer a criminal offender conditional relief from a potential jail sentence. If the offender meets regularly with a probation officer and complies with court-mandated benchmarks of good behavior for a fixed period of time, they escape a harsher sentence the court would otherwise impose. Courts in some US states charge offenders fees to help defray the costs of running a probation service. This is called \u201coffender-funded\u201d probation.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Probation companies offer courts, counties, and municipalities a deal that sounds too good to be true\u2014they will offer probation services in misdemeanor cases without asking for a single dime of public revenue. All they ask in return is the right to collect fees from the probationers they supervise, and that courts make probationers\u2019 freedom contingent on paying those fees. Those fees make up most probation companies\u2019 entire stream of revenue and profits.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Some local officials turn to probation companies because they are facing genuine financial hardship. An increasing number of counties and municipalities depend on local courts as sources of revenue by trying to fund through misdemeanor fines what they cannot or will not fund through taxation. But the same courts often argue that they cannot afford to hire clerks or other personnel to track whether offenders on long-term payment plans are paying what they owe in fines.</p> </blockquote> <p>The problems raised by these arrangements aren't confined to the South. Forms of these practices are in place in Montana, Utah, Michigan, and Missouri as well. And it's not as if the officials making deals with these private companies can claim anymore that they are unaware of the consequences of these programs upon their constituents. In fact, by outsourcing these collection efforts, by unshackling them from the chains of "state action" and then failing to adequately oversee them, officials in these jurisdictions are engaging in affirmatively hostile acts toward their poorest constituents. More from the HRW report:</p> <blockquote> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Many courts have re-purposed probation into a debt collection tool and are primarily interested in the services of probation companies as a means towards that end. In what is euphemistically referred to as \u201cpay only\u201d probation, people are sentenced to probation for just one reason: they don\u2019t have money and they need time to pay down their fines and court costs. Pay only probation is an extremely muscular form of debt collection masquerading as probation supervision, with all costs billed to the debtor. It is essentially a legal fiction and it is the cornerstone of many probation companies\u2019 business.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Offenders on pay only probation could wash their hands of the criminal justice system on the day of their court appearance if only they had the money on hand to pay their fines and court costs immediately and in full. Because they can\u2019t, they are put on probation for periods of up to several years while they gradually pay down their debts to the court. Each month, they are charged an additional \u201csupervision fee\u201d by their probation company, whose only task is to collect their money and monitor whether they are keeping up with scheduled payments.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The central problem with offender-funded, pay only probation is this: the longer it takes offenders to pay off their debts, the longer they remain on probation and the more they pay in supervision fees. In other words, the poorer a person is the more they ultimately pay and the longer they have to live with the threat of possible incarceration hanging over their heads. Some low-income offenders end up paying more in fees to their probation company than they were sentenced to pay in fines to begin with. Those fees are costs an offender of greater economic means could avoid altogether.</p> </blockquote> <p>After years of chaos and heartbreak, the nation's judges are only now beginning to catch on to the significant legal and constitutional questions raised by these practices. (Another form of this phenomenon is represented by the nationwide push to impose civil forfeiture on citizens, a story <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/08/12/130812fa_fact_stillman?currentPage=all">chronicled so well last summer by Sarah Stillman</a> in <em>The New Yorker.</em>) But judicial remedies will be a long time in coming, especially in those places where state officials are nudged in the opposite direction by probation industry lobbyists. This is a national scandal. It merits national attention. And HRW deserves credit for saying so.</p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-private-probation-problem-is-worse-than-anyone-thought%2F283589%2F&amp;t=The+Private+Probation+Problem+Is+Worse+Than+Anyone+Thought" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-private-probation-problem-is-worse-than-anyone-thought%2F283589%2F&amp;t=The+Private+Probation+Problem+Is+Worse+Than+Anyone+Thought" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-private-probation-problem-is-worse-than-anyone-thought%2F283589%2F&amp;t=The+Private+Probation+Problem+Is+Worse+Than+Anyone+Thought" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-private-probation-problem-is-worse-than-anyone-thought%2F283589%2F&amp;t=The+Private+Probation+Problem+Is+Worse+Than+Anyone+Thought" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Fthe-private-probation-problem-is-worse-than-anyone-thought%2F283589%2F&amp;t=The+Private+Probation+Problem+Is+Worse+Than+Anyone+Thought" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/sc/22/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530141429/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36bc97e5/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/yu2pKfMWdjM" width="1" />

And while it's an in-house manual made public (slash a smart publicity play, slash a de-facto declaration that Buzzfeed places itself in the company of the AP and <em>The New York Times</em>, slash "slash" instead of "/" is not, for the record, officially sanctioned by Buzzfeed's Style Guide) ... the document is also chock-full of answers about common Internet-term quandaries. And, Buzzfeed being Buzzfeed, it can also nicely double as an answer to some of the web's most pressing Style Conundrums. </p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">For example: According to BuzzGuide, it's "de-friend (not unfriend)." "Email," not "e-mail." "U</span>sername," not "user name." <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">And "website / web / webpage."</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Possibly also relevant, should your writing require this: It's "s</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">ide-eye," with a hyphen, but "sideboob," one word. (And "sidebutt.")</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">It's also "</span>bro-down" and "bro-ing," a<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">nd "</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">First World problem," with two upper-cases and one lower-, and </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">"Gchat," with a capital-G, and</span></p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">bougie (<em>adj.</em>), bougiest (from bourgeoisie).</span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">As for proper names? It's "Yahoo (no !)" and "Facebook (always capped, in any form)" and "</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Craigslist" and </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">"Reddit (cap in running text), redditor (lowercase, for someone who uses Reddit)" and "Twitter / tweeting / tweets" and also "</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">Twitterstorm."</span></p> <p><span>It's also </span>"Jay Z (no hyphen)," "J.Lo," and "Cee Lo Green."</p> <p>And since we've veered into IRL territory, here is, for my money, the most useful advice the guide has to offer:</p> <blockquote> <p><span>cheese: What\u2019s capped and what\u2019s not? Consult MW [Merriam-Webster], but here\u2019s a list of some commonly referenced cheeses: Brie, cheddar, Comté, Feta, Fontina, Gruyère, Monterey Jack, mozzarella, Parmesan, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Romano</span></p> </blockquote> <p><span>Helpful! Though I remain confused about whether to capitalize "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouda_cheese">gouda</a>." </span></p> <p><span>Anyhow. Do with all this what you will\u2014for non-Buzzfeed writers, these aren't rules so much as helpful pieces of advice. Follow them to the letter; ignore them; do what's in your heart, because that is what the Internet ultimately asks of us all. </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">There are, it's worth noting, a couple instances in which Buzzfeed's guide lists exceptions to its own rules. Ad when are those to be deployed? In those cases, the document says, when following the original rule just "looks weird." </span></p><img border="0" height="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/36b76253/sc/21/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div class="mf-viral"><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Flol-and-or-lol-the-internet-has-a-style-guide-now%2F283596%2F&amp;t=LOL+and%2For+Lol%21+The+Internet+Has+a+Style+Guide+Now" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Flol-and-or-lol-the-internet-has-a-style-guide-now%2F283596%2F&amp;t=LOL+and%2For+Lol%21+The+Internet+Has+a+Style+Guide+Now" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Flol-and-or-lol-the-internet-has-a-style-guide-now%2F283596%2F&amp;t=LOL+and%2For+Lol%21+The+Internet+Has+a+Style+Guide+Now" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Flol-and-or-lol-the-internet-has-a-style-guide-now%2F283596%2F&amp;t=LOL+and%2For+Lol%21+The+Internet+Has+a+Style+Guide+Now" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F02%2Flol-and-or-lol-the-internet-has-a-style-guide-now%2F283596%2F&amp;t=LOL+and%2For+Lol%21+The+Internet+Has+a+Style+Guide+Now" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186530117250/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/36b76253/a2t.img" width="1" /><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/bjHxMxW92Go" width="1" />
